It‚Äôs easily tilts which makes me nervous sometimes b/c I almost feel like I‚Äôll tilt too far back & fall BUT that has NOT happened. Chair got 3 stars b/c it does not roll smoothly although it does have wheels. I have tile floors no carpet & I still feel like the chair does not roll like it should. It was cost efficient & matches perfect with my small desk so it‚Äôs still a WIN for me. I do not need to roll anyway üòÇ","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 October 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars"

So far its worked pretty well. I did have one issue with assembly because I put the base of the chair on backxwards (the part with the lever), so the chair would tilt forward instead of backwards, so make sure to put it on like in the picture on this product page. It was also a little difficult to screw stuff on because the holes werent very well alligned, but once I got it together, it was sturdy. Spins well, and tilts well (once I put the base on correctly).","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 April 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

It is the perfect size for my height. I am 5‚Äô0 so the chair fits me perfectly, and it is not bulky at all. If you‚Äôre looking for a chair that doesn‚Äôt take up all that space then this would be perfect. My husband is 5‚Äô8 normal built, and it was too small for him, so I would not recommend this chair for a tall heavy person because it would be too snug. It would also recommend it for a child‚Äôs/teenagers study desk too.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 July 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Put together easily and works wonderful. I ordered one chair for myself, while putting it together one of the screws on the seat would not go all the way in. I returned it ordered a second one and and two screws on the bottom of the seat would not go all the way in and would fall out. I return this one too.

Assembly time was 30 minutes with one cup of coffee.  Looks nice. Now here is the primary kudo, 1x fastener each and plastic cap were included as spares, something I am beginning to see more often - nice.Cons: Instructions could have been more verbose, I myself didn't need it, but I could see some people would. The plastic plugs that cover the four screws on the back of the chair continuously fall out. Simple solution, a small dab of hot glue, just small dab, so you can take them back out if ever needed.  I imagine that Elmers Glue (a small dab) would do the same trick.Overall, the price of $39.99 made it a sweet deal if it lasts for several years. The price is why I bumped it up to 5 stars. My office chair is mountain gorilla-butt strength and runs over $250.00.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

At most there were two wheels that moved a little bit but couldn‚Äôt make the whole chair move since the other wheels wouldn‚Äôt budge. If the wheels moved I would‚Äôve kept since i like the color combo and it was a good deal but if it doesn‚Äôt feel super comfy AND doesn‚Äôt move it‚Äôs just a waste of money at this point. Maybe I got a bad pair of wheels? Not sure, but pretty disappointed.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 August 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"

My butt and specifically my tail bone said, ""Pressure overload, spinal injury will likely occur in 30 minutes!""I used my hand sensors to inspect the chair material and discovered it was quite lumpy. It appeared to have springs inside the chair creating an uneven distribution of pressure.I looked at my old chair and noticed that it had a low spot in the same area where this new chair was creating the most pressure.I can only conclude that the engineers who made this chair either have never sat in a chair or have no large humans nearby to test said chair and communicate that the chair is not useful for sitting purposes.Now I, as a busy human, decided to try said chair for a few days. As the days progressed, my body posture contorted to multiple sitting positions to avoid the pressure without much success. My tail bone did indeed begin to express pain.My brain concluded: ""Sitting in such a chair for many hours a day would certainly lead to long term damage.""Not wanting to spend additional money on another chair. I jotted a note in my brain storage for future reference: In the future, perhaps buying a chair, butt-untested, is not a great idea. Next time I will have to visit a physical-presence-selling-place-that-allows-butt-testing.Then I began my journey towards chair refactoring:After taking off the chair-back with the four support bolts - using the hex tool which came with the chair. I needed to acquire my trusted utility tool.This tool is my long-time companion which I always carry on my belt when I am wearing pants. Of course being in my home-environment without pants, I had to first travel to my clothing-storage-area to obtain my utility tool from the last-worn-pants.After removing some of the staples on the back edge of the chair, I had enough room to begin inspecting the interior of the chair's butt-support structure. I quickly found the offense:Someone had decided to place the box-springs from a small doll's bed inside the middle of my chair.I disagreed with that decision.After removing a few more staples from the cover material, I removed the box-springs entirely from the chair.At first, I thought I would modify them, but after seeing the result shape of the chair now resembled my old chair. I decided it was time for a butt-test.I was pleasantly surprised. The pressure distribution was now even and almost perfect - matching ideal butt-support specifications.tl;dr: - 5 stars after chair surgery (1 star before)","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 5 August 2022","4.1 out of 5 stars"

It was cheap, had a high weight limit, looked strong. It is strong, very strong. It feels like it will last, it tilts back well, it feels sturdy - even the plastic arms feel sturdy. But the seat. The place your butt goes - it's awful. Within a day (I work from home, I sit a lot) my ass was hurting. I read some other reviews and I agree, there are springs or hard things in the center that are pushing up, but the pressure is killing me.

I am not ""big and tall"" but wanted a wider chair so that my small dogs could sit alongside me in an office chair while I work on managing our empire.  I decided to purchase the good but used version to save a couple of dollars cause I'm cheap as heck, lol.  Chair came in a somewhat damaged box.  It was fairly easy to put together but the instructions are only picture so I wasn't 100% sure about some things, like how to put the wheels on.  The instructions didn't say anything other than showing the male wheel part going in to the female chair part so I wasn't sure they would click inside and hold in place but they did.  It's comfortable to sit in.  Downside is that the lumbar piece that slides up and down doesn't slide all the way down cause it's meant for someone taller, haha.My biggest issue with the item is that all of the screws were not in the package.  I am missing one of the screws where the back attaches on to the underneath of the chair seat and all of the arm piece screws are missing.  So I cannot attach the arms to the chair.  While I can use the chair without the arms in place, it sorta defeats the purpose of buying this chair cause I can't put the pillow in place for the dogs to lay on.  My own fault for saving a few dollars and buying a good but used chair.  Had no idea it wouldn't have all the parts to go with it.  Hoping to buy the screws locally so I can attach the arms and the last screw on the bottom.  Otherwise I'm happy with the item itself.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

With that said I'm really in no rush to replace this.  I'm 6'4, almost 300lb, the chair feels great.  The assembly was slightly annoying (I just wish the base was preassembled and welded instead of the machine screws- still very sturdy!).  The mesh back is change for me and feels great in long gaming or work sessions, the seat cushion is very respectable for the moneyPros:+Feels sturdy from the moment I sat on it+Solid metal/steel support components+Price to value (to me)+The ""3d armrests"" adjust vertically easy but don't rotate like my old chair... Which I prefer!!!!  The can be adjusted narrow or weirder with an allen wrench/key (came with a solid one and a nice handle to make building easier)+Decent instructions+Decent lumbar adjustmentCons:-Assembley can be cumbersome, might need an extra pair of hands to hold things in place to assemble, although if you're patient take your time you can do it alone.-each spoke on the base is attached with two fairly heavy duty machine screws, does feel good, but personally just wish this was preassembled and welded.-if you're significantly taller than me, say 6'6 and above the back my might be a bit low.  For me I prefer this for acoustic reasons (I'm an audiophile and don't want my head in reflection zone like most gamer chairs do).

It's easy to assemble. The wheels work well on my carpet. It's sturdy enough, overall. It's big! It's probably larger than what I needed, or realized when I bought it. But it works! I have lower back disc issues and a bruised tail bone. I use a special butt-pillow while sitting on this (and any) chair. So far I haven't had any pain arise while using this chair. The back rest is mesh and very firm. I guess that's good considering the weight it's supposed to support. The lumbar piece is really firm, too, which I dislike, but then again, my back hasn't had any problems with it as it does with other office chairs, so maybe this firmness is what my back needs. The seat cushion of the chair is cushy and I could see it being uncomfortable and flattened after prolonged use, so I'd recommend buying an additional cushion if you're like me and have back/butt issues. The arms are adjustable up/down. Since the seat is extra wide, the arms aren't squishing into my sides. The back doesn't recline independently from the chair (a feature my in-office chair has) but rather the whole seat tilts back slightly (not very far).

I've loved it and it's served me well. I'm 6'0 and pushing 400 so it definitely held up its end...for a year.  Within 9 months the back plastic piece along the middle broke and wouldn't stay on.  It's no doubt associated with the weight being pushed onto the ergonomic piece and back into the plastic.  I wasn't upset at that, it's simply an aesthetic piece which served no real purpose.The part I'm mad about though is the seat plate. Around 6 months in the lever to keep it from leaning started to slip and I'd jolt backwards, not the end of the world, I just stopped leaning back as much and checked the lever more frequently.  However, after a slip I noticed the chair had a slight lean to the left where the lever sticks into. I examined it and noticed that some parts had broke and small metal bits were cracked. it's progressively gotten worse and now after a year, I cannot use the chair as it's lean is constant and unsustainable for my back.I wish products advertised as size friendly would also have the same durability as those meant for smaller folk.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I am 5 foot 5 and weigh over 350 pounds. I am also very hippy - I carry that weight in my butt and thighs. This chair is wide enough to accommodate  my massive backside.When I was putting it together a small piece of plastic that was part of the back broke, so the back did not come together as tightly as it should. Picture 2 shows the gap - but I could not tell that it caused any functional issues so I let it be.With my weight and the casters that were provided, I was hurting my knees getting the chair to move - so I replaced the casters that came with the chair with the rollerblade type casters - that solved that problem. I also added arm cushions to the arm rests. I like the adjustability of the arm rests - they seem to stay put wherever you put them so you can get the height to meet your needs.I have had no problem keeping the chair at the right height - although I now have it at the lowest position because this is most comfortable for my legs.The lumbar support pillow behind the back slides up and down, but does not stay where I put it and ends up down at the bottom by the end of the day. Since I do have a big backside I need the lumbar to be higher.My big issue is that I seem to have worn down any support that existed in the seat cushion. By the end of the day my butt just hurts. I have tried adding a cushion, but that makes the chair too tall for me to easily get in to it. (One of the unspoken issues with being large and trying to sit in a chair with wheels is that you can easily shoot the chair across the room and end up on the floor if you can't sit down into it with enough of your behind in the chair.)I think this chair would be perfectly fine if I was only using it a few hours a day. In fact, I'm good in it for about 4-5 hours a day. It just does not work for me for all day and I have ordered a more expensive chair.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 August 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I examined it and noticed that some parts had broke and small metal bits were cracked. it's progressively gotten worse and now after a year, I cannot use the chair as it's lean is constant and unsustainable for my back.I wish products advertised as size friendly would also have the same durability as those meant for smaller folk.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I am 5 foot 5 and weigh over 350 pounds. I am also very hippy - I carry that weight in my butt and thighs. This chair is wide enough to accommodate  my massive backside.When I was putting it together a small piece of plastic that was part of the back broke, so the back did not come together as tightly as it should. Picture 2 shows the gap - but I could not tell that it caused any functional issues so I let it be.With my weight and the casters that were provided, I was hurting my knees getting the chair to move - so I replaced the casters that came with the chair with the rollerblade type casters - that solved that problem. I also added arm cushions to the arm rests. I like the adjustability of the arm rests - they seem to stay put wherever you put them so you can get the height to meet your needs.I have had no problem keeping the chair at the right height - although I now have it at the lowest position because this is most comfortable for my legs.The lumbar support pillow behind the back slides up and down, but does not stay where I put it and ends up down at the bottom by the end of the day. Since I do have a big backside I need the lumbar to be higher.My big issue is that I seem to have worn down any support that existed in the seat cushion. By the end of the day my butt just hurts. I have tried adding a cushion, but that makes the chair too tall for me to easily get in to it. (One of the unspoken issues with being large and trying to sit in a chair with wheels is that you can easily shoot the chair across the room and end up on the floor if you can't sit down into it with enough of your behind in the chair.)I think this chair would be perfectly fine if I was only using it a few hours a day. In fact, I'm good in it for about 4-5 hours a day. It just does not work for me for all day and I have ordered a more expensive chair.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 August 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's easy to assemble. The wheels work well on my carpet. It's sturdy enough, overall. It's big! It's probably larger than what I needed, or realized when I bought it. But it works! I have lower back disc issues and a bruised tail bone. I use a special butt-pillow while sitting on this (and any) chair. So far I haven't had any pain arise while using this chair. The back rest is mesh and very firm. I guess that's good considering the weight it's supposed to support. The lumbar piece is really firm, too, which I dislike, but then again, my back hasn't had any problems with it as it does with other office chairs, so maybe this firmness is what my back needs. The seat cushion of the chair is cushy and I could see it being uncomfortable and flattened after prolonged use, so I'd recommend buying an additional cushion if you're like me and have back/butt issues. The arms are adjustable up/down. Since the seat is extra wide, the arms aren't squishing into my sides. The back doesn't recline independently from the chair (a feature my in-office chair has) but rather the whole seat tilts back slightly (not very far).

It's easy to assemble. The wheels work well on my carpet. It's sturdy enough, overall. It's big! It's probably larger than what I needed, or realized when I bought it. But it works! I have lower back disc issues and a bruised tail bone. I use a special butt-pillow while sitting on this (and any) chair. So far I haven't had any pain arise while using this chair. The back rest is mesh and very firm. I guess that's good considering the weight it's supposed to support. The lumbar piece is really firm, too, which I dislike, but then again, my back hasn't had any problems with it as it does with other office chairs, so maybe this firmness is what my back needs. The seat cushion of the chair is cushy and I could see it being uncomfortable and flattened after prolonged use, so I'd recommend buying an additional cushion if you're like me and have back/butt issues. The arms are adjustable up/down. Since the seat is extra wide, the arms aren't squishing into my sides. The back doesn't recline independently from the chair (a feature my in-office chair has) but rather the whole seat tilts back slightly (not very far). Overall, good chair.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I've loved it and it's served me well. I'm 6'0 and pushing 400 so it definitely held up its end...for a year.  Within 9 months the back plastic piece along the middle broke and wouldn't stay on.  It's no doubt associated with the weight being pushed onto the ergonomic piece and back into the plastic.  I wasn't upset at that, it's simply an aesthetic piece which served no real purpose.The part I'm mad about though is the seat plate. Around 6 months in the lever to keep it from leaning started to slip and I'd jolt backwards, not the end of the world, I just stopped leaning back as much and checked the lever more frequently.  However, after a slip I noticed the chair had a slight lean to the left where the lever sticks into. I examined it and noticed that some parts had broke and small metal bits were cracked. it's progressively gotten worse and now after a year, I cannot use the chair as it's lean is constant and unsustainable for my back.I wish products advertised as size friendly would also have the same durability as those meant for smaller folk.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I am 5 foot 5 and weigh over 350 pounds. I am also very hippy - I carry that weight in my butt and thighs. This chair is wide enough to accommodate  my massive backside.When I was putting it together a small piece of plastic that was part of the back broke, so the back did not come together as tightly as it should. Picture 2 shows the gap - but I could not tell that it caused any functional issues so I let it be.With my weight and the casters that were provided, I was hurting my knees getting the chair to move - so I replaced the casters that came with the chair with the rollerblade type casters - that solved that problem. I also added arm cushions to the arm rests. I like the adjustability of the arm rests - they seem to stay put wherever you put them so you can get the height to meet your needs.I have had no problem keeping the chair at the right height - although I now have it at the lowest position because this is most comfortable for my legs.The lumbar support pillow behind the back slides up and down, but does not stay where I put it and ends up down at the bottom by the end of the day. Since I do have a big backside I need the lumbar to be higher.My big issue is that I seem to have worn down any support that existed in the seat cushion. By the end of the day my butt just hurts. I have tried adding a cushion, but that makes the chair too tall for me to easily get in to it. (One of the unspoken issues with being large and trying to sit in a chair with wheels is that you can easily shoot the chair across the room and end up on the floor if you can't sit down into it with enough of your behind in the chair.)I think this chair would be perfectly fine if I was only using it a few hours a day. In fact, I'm good in it for about 4-5 hours a day. It just does not work for me for all day and I have ordered a more expensive chair.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 August 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Nach 3 Tagen war bereits eine Seite der Fu√üablage auf der Sitzfl√§che gebrochen. Die Feststellung der R√ºckenlehne wird immer lockerer. Und nur durchs gem√ºtliche aufst√ºtzen macht die rechte Armlehne auch schon die Gr√§tsche und es fehlt nicht mehr viel das auch diese bald rausbricht.

"166","chair","Flash Furniture X20 Gaming Chair Racing Office Ergonomic Computer PC Adjustable Swivel Chair with Fully Reclining Back in Red LeatherSoft","alldoingkoifish","Es la primera vez que hago una rese√±a en amazon. He tenido la necesidad de, despu√©s de montar y probar la silla por un par de horas, venir corriendo para deciros que NO LA COMPREIS! Pido perd√≥n adelantado por si me sale alguna palabrota, pues estoy muy, muy, muy cabreado con la porquer√≠a que me ha llegado.Es, sinceramente, la peor silla que he tenido en toda mi vida. Os juro que no exagero. Suelo pasarme entre 4 y 8 horas delante del ordenador al d√≠a, y siempre he tenido sillas de oficina normales. Por una vez pens√© que una silla de estas ""gaming"" podr√≠a dar el pego con mi nuevo setup y decid√≠ lanzarme. Cagada total.Inc√≥moda: los cojines son muy delgados y demasiado blandos, y el respaldo queda muy alejado de los reposabrazos, que solo son regulables en altura. El tejido me ha parecido demasiado caliente, de los que te hacen sudar de valiente, y mira que estamos en pleno invierno (estoy a 16¬∫ en mi oficina). No me quiero imaginar como ser√≠a esta porquer√≠a en verano.Mal√≠sima calidad: la tela es de lo peor que he visto nunca en una silla. Incluso una silla de oficina de 60-80‚Ç¨ tiene mejores telas. Solo de abrir el paquete, han saltado 4 grapas de debajo el asiento y ya hay un trozo de tela suelto en una esquina inferior. Las ruedas son de pl√°stico barato, al igual que la base.Montaje: tedioso. Ni te plantees montarla con las herramientas que trae. Te vas a desesperar. En muchos agujeros, los tornillos se encallan por los trozos de tela que se meten en la rosca. Hay alg√∫n par de agujeros que no encajan y tienes que forzar un poco.Sinceramente quer√≠a echar unas fotos y colgarlas, pero es que no pienso perder m√°s tiempo en esto, que entre el montaje y escribir esta rese√±a ya llevo 2 horas. Ahora solo pensar que tengo que desmontarlo todo para que se la puedan llevar de vuelta me da dolor de cabeza.Lo que m√°s rabia me da es que es una silla de unos 230‚Ç¨. Con 230‚Ç¨ cualquier persona se puede pensar que es una silla tirando m√°s a premium que a b√°sica, pero no. Sinceramente me siento muy estafado. Hasta he enviado un correo a los fabricantes cag√°ndome en ellos y para pedirles que paren de estafar a la gente.Es m√°s, compr√© esta silla reacondicionada, sin los cojines (de los que no puedo opinar, aunque los he sustituido por unos parecidos de una silla de un colega para poder decidir si compraba unos a parte o no) por 90‚Ç¨ y a√∫n me siento muy estafado. He tenido sillas de 50‚Ç¨ que le dan diez mil vueltas a esta porquer√≠a, en comodidad y en calidad.

I expected that to primarily manifest in material quality and comfort, but something that I didn't consider was noise. After half a year, this thing squeaks loudly with even the smallest movement. I often work with headphones, but it becomes problematic for video meetings and it's to the point where I'm scared stiff (literally) during meetings as I try not to move or adjust my weight so as not to cause distractions for the meeting.

"220","chair","Vnewone Ergonomic Office Chair Desk Computer Mesh Executive Task Rolling Gaming Swivel Modern Adjustable with Mid Back Lumbar Support Armrest for Home Women Men, Black","Betty","I guess you get what you pay for - I was disappointed that the seat cushion was about a half-inch taller on the left side than the right. I'm trying to even it out by adding a blanket folded so fewer layers are on the lower side. The challenge is I also had to add a two-inch seat cushion for this chair to be at an ergonomic height for a standard desk. Otherwise, the desk was higher than my elbows and therefore would not be at 90 degrees. I am 5' 5"" tall - which is an average height for many women. I would not recommend this chair - the only good features were that it was easy to assemble and the back support would be great if I didn't have to raise myself up to get my elbows to the right height.  I guess if your tall and don't have back issues (like I do), sitting a tilt wouldn't bother you... but it sure bothers me since I have a herniated disc at L4-L5. The cushion I have to use brings my lower back up too high to enjoy the back support.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 July 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I needed something small that would fit in a small space but still be comfortable. The assemble took about 40 minutes or so. The process could potentially go faster if you had some help. The instructions were not super great but it was doable. It does come with everything you need to assemble it. The chair shipped within a week which is not bad. It does come in the manufactures box so it's obvious what it is.The chair itself is small. Im 5'2"" and it's almost like the perfect chair. I cant imagine a taller person enjoying this chair comfortably. Even at it's tallest I can still touch the floor which is not very common for me with office/task chairs. The cushion itself isn't the most comfortable but it will do. However, the back of the chair is very comfortable.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 July 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars"

And porous so holds all the dirt and doesn't allow for wipe off because it will break!This thing is white! It needs to be sturdy for cleaning.It's super uncomfortable. You can't change the back angle at all and it's too straight.The padding of the seat is sooooo cheap. It has no bounce whatsoever.

"372","chair","Flash Furniture High Back Office Chair | White LeatherSoft Office Chair with Wheels and Arms","Prakhar Goel","Overall, this chair was mostly fine with one serious problem: the back isn't well supported. It looks like a solid back but it's just a metal frame with fabric and elastic in the interior of the back. When I lean back into the chair, the back just gives way (see second picture). My last chair had a continuous board in the very back so that the back padding compressed against something sturdy. This chair just seems to have an elastic band buried in there. Even worse, I can feel it when I lean back. Another minor gripe is that the chair felt a bit small but that could just be that I'm used to somewhat oversized chairs and I like to sit cross-legged in the chair sometime.Other than that, the chair was fine. It arrived on time and undamaged. The packaging was reasonable and assembly was quick. There were some minor imperfections (first and third pictures) but nothing serious.

"379","chair","Flash Furniture High Back Office Chair | White LeatherSoft Office Chair with Wheels and Arms","CJade","UPDATE 1 Year Review: The positives I gave this chair some credit for on my initial reviews was looks and cushion. Well, after using this chair 3-5 days a week while working from home for a year, I can honestly say the initial cushion quality has gone out the window. The cushion has not held up....to the point where I‚Äôm shopping for a new chair already and I plan on spending a lot more money to get a sturdy, higher quality chair. This chai wobbles and moves in places it shouldn‚Äôt now, I feel the cheap sub material through the cushion now, and so honestly regret this purchase. It looks decent and is okay if you‚Äôre a lighter/smaller person it might be good for the only, but otherwise run away.I originally posted this review with a 4 star rating, but after working from home for a week on it, I am updating my review to sow a 3 star rating based on how uncomfortable I feel sitting in it for a long period of time. It has its upside but ultimately it is a small/tight fitting chair that is now with the money for taller people wanting it for regular use.Cons:I saw some reviews talking about how narrow the arm rests/seat area is. I figured these were picky or oversized people. Turns out they were right. Compared to my prior chair from Office Max, this chair is WAY more narrow. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sized/athletic shaped and slender....my hips are right at the arm rests (not touching but very close). Compared to my old chair, the arm rests also extend towards the front of the seat more....coupled with the narrow seat opening, the arm rests length makes it harder to get out of the chair at an angled direction. I have to swivel my chair completely sideways and stand up straight instead of partially turning and sliding in or out sideways. Also, the seat is not only narrow sideways but is is ‚Äúshort‚Äù longways.... sitting all the way back, the seat goes about halfway toward my knees.... my old chair went almost to my knee area (difference that is noticeable in comfort/weight distribution ). It seats almost like a driver side seat in a car given how most of your weight is on just your butt and instead of spread down your hamstrings, too. The chair just seems disproportionate and smaller than it should be. Smaller people might be good though. Last complaint is I ordered a black chair and they mailed me a white one. Easily fixed but still annoying and shouldn‚Äôt happen.Pros:Whatever shortcomings it has in comfort because of design/size, it at least got it right in the padding. This chair is one of the more comfortable home office chairs I‚Äôve sat in under $200 when it comes to the seat cushion. The padding seems to be thick and solid without being too supportive or too soft. Aside from that, the overall look is very sharp. The chrome is nicely done and spruces the chair‚Äôs appearance up. They did a good job on the overall look. Also, the chair went together quite easily. Packaging was good, too.Conclusion:While there is enough of a cramped seat feeling to make it worth 2 stars deduction, and if it was too much smaller I would have returned it, the chair is nice enough looking and cushioned enough to make the $105 chair worth keeping now that I have it...and at the end of the day it is just big enough to work. I work from home and have already spent several hours sitting and it seems to be a a decision I‚Äôll be able to live with, but I wouldn‚Äôt order it again if I could do it all over.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 May 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"380","chair","Flash Furniture High Back Office Chair | White LeatherSoft Office Chair with Wheels and Arms","Jason","This chair looks nice and is very comfortable. I really wish it came with a gold finish instead of chrome, but for the price you can't get everything you want. It came packed well and delivery was quick and easy. I put this together in about 45 minutes. I used a ratchet screwdriver instead of the Allen wrench provided. Many people said that the castors were hard to pop in,  but they popped right in for me. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons- first, the holes on the right side of the chair did not line up well. I would have had this chair put together much faster if it wasn't for this. After some trial and error, I had to complete the left side first (back and arm) in order to be able to pull the pieces together tight enough to make the holes line up on the right side.  Even then it was a struggle.  The other reason is that it can with a slight tear on the very back of the seat piece. It was covered once the back was put on, but it does raise concerns about the longevity of the chair. This is for a home office with limited usage, but I think if my dogs jump on it, it may tear. I will update this review if there are any issues. Overall, not a bad piece. Slightly overpriced for the issues. This was my first time putting a chair together.** update** Although the size of this chair is great for me at 5' tall, my husband (6') mentioned it being a little small for him. The seat is narrow and short. Not something I noticed, but he wouldn't be comfortable all day in it. He also noticed lots of ways to adjust the chair- I didn't realize you could adjust the lumbar support!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 3 February 2018","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"389","chair","Flash Furniture High Back Office Chair | White LeatherSoft Office Chair with Wheels and Arms","CJade","UPDATE 1 Year Review: The positives I gave this chair some credit for on my initial reviews was looks and cushion. Well, after using this chair 3-5 days a week while working from home for a year, I can honestly say the initial cushion quality has gone out the window. The cushion has not held up....to the point where I‚Äôm shopping for a new chair already and I plan on spending a lot more money to get a sturdy, higher quality chair. This chai wobbles and moves in places it shouldn‚Äôt now, I feel the cheap sub material through the cushion now, and so honestly regret this purchase. It looks decent and is okay if you‚Äôre a lighter/smaller person it might be good for the only, but otherwise run away.I originally posted this review with a 4 star rating, but after working from home for a week on it, I am updating my review to sow a 3 star rating based on how uncomfortable I feel sitting in it for a long period of time. It has its upside but ultimately it is a small/tight fitting chair that is now with the money for taller people wanting it for regular use.Cons:I saw some reviews talking about how narrow the arm rests/seat area is. I figured these were picky or oversized people. Turns out they were right. Compared to my prior chair from Office Max, this chair is WAY more narrow. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sized/athletic shaped and slender....my hips are right at the arm rests (not touching but very close). Compared to my old chair, the arm rests also extend towards the front of the seat more....coupled with the narrow seat opening, the arm rests length makes it harder to get out of the chair at an angled direction. I have to swivel my chair completely sideways and stand up straight instead of partially turning and sliding in or out sideways. Also, the seat is not only narrow sideways but is is ‚Äúshort‚Äù longways.... sitting all the way back, the seat goes about halfway toward my knees.... my old chair went almost to my knee area (difference that is noticeable in comfort/weight distribution ). It seats almost like a driver side seat in a car given how most of your weight is on just your butt and instead of spread down your hamstrings, too. The chair just seems disproportionate and smaller than it should be. Smaller people might be good though. Last complaint is I ordered a black chair and they mailed me a white one. Easily fixed but still annoying and shouldn‚Äôt happen.Pros:Whatever shortcomings it has in comfort because of design/size, it at least got it right in the padding. This chair is one of the more comfortable home office chairs I‚Äôve sat in under $200 when it comes to the seat cushion. The padding seems to be thick and solid without being too supportive or too soft. Aside from that, the overall look is very sharp. The chrome is nicely done and spruces the chair‚Äôs appearance up. They did a good job on the overall look. Also, the chair went together quite easily. Packaging was good, too.Conclusion:While there is enough of a cramped seat feeling to make it worth 2 stars deduction, and if it was too much smaller I would have returned it, the chair is nice enough looking and cushioned enough to make the $105 chair worth keeping now that I have it...and at the end of the day it is just big enough to work. I work from home and have already spent several hours sitting and it seems to be a a decision I‚Äôll be able to live with, but I wouldn‚Äôt order it again if I could do it all over.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 May 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I really wish it came with a gold finish instead of chrome, but for the price you can't get everything you want. It came packed well and delivery was quick and easy. I put this together in about 45 minutes. I used a ratchet screwdriver instead of the Allen wrench provided. Many people said that the castors were hard to pop in,  but they popped right in for me. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons- first, the holes on the right side of the chair did not line up well. I would have had this chair put together much faster if it wasn't for this. After some trial and error, I had to complete the left side first (back and arm) in order to be able to pull the pieces together tight enough to make the holes line up on the right side.  Even then it was a struggle.  The other reason is that it can with a slight tear on the very back of the seat piece. It was covered once the back was put on, but it does raise concerns about the longevity of the chair. This is for a home office with limited usage, but I think if my dogs jump on it, it may tear. I will update this review if there are any issues. Overall, not a bad piece. Slightly overpriced for the issues.

"392","chair","Flash Furniture High Back Office Chair | White LeatherSoft Office Chair with Wheels and Arms","Prakhar Goel","Overall, this chair was mostly fine with one serious problem: the back isn't well supported. It looks like a solid back but it's just a metal frame with fabric and elastic in the interior of the back. When I lean back into the chair, the back just gives way (see second picture). My last chair had a continuous board in the very back so that the back padding compressed against something sturdy. This chair just seems to have an elastic band buried in there. Even worse, I can feel it when I lean back. Another minor gripe is that the chair felt a bit small but that could just be that I'm used to somewhat oversized chairs and I like to sit cross-legged in the chair sometime.Other than that, the chair was fine. It arrived on time and undamaged. The packaging was reasonable and assembly was quick. There were some minor imperfections (first and third pictures) but nothing serious.

It's a cheap office chair, but she's little, so no big deal.  It was easy to assemble.  It's comfortable enough.  BUT - the hydraulic is shot within 45 days of use by a 6 yr old...  She's not constantly adjusting it up and down.  Over time, any weight in the seat lowers the hydraulic instantly.  Now she can't sit high enough to be at her desk.  I tried to return it, but Amazon said I'd need to box it up.  Nobody has time to disassemble a busted chair and find a box for it to fit in.Learn from my lesson.  Buy a different chair.

I see the seller increased the price. I don't respect that at all. Price gouging is disgusting. Sellers are taking advantage of the increased need for home office furniture and supplies.In terms of the chair, there are better options out there. The chair was easy for me to assemble. It took about 20 minutes. There really is no support in the cushion. And the worst part is it squeaks so loudly. Every movement on the chair, there is a loud jarring squeak. I've tried using products to lubricate the moving parts and nothing has worked. The chair works for it's intended purpose, sitting at a desk. It's loud and uncomfortable. I would not recommend it.

Assembly time was 30 minutes with one cup of coffee.  Looks nice. Now here is the primary kudo, 1x fastener each and plastic cap were included as spares, something I am beginning to see more often - nice.Cons: Instructions could have been more verbose, I myself didn't need it, but I could see some people would. The plastic plugs that cover the four screws on the back of the chair continuously fall out. Simple solution, a small dab of hot glue, just small dab, so you can take them back out if ever needed.  I imagine that Elmers Glue (a small dab) would do the same trick.Overall, the price of $39.99 made it a sweet deal if it lasts for several years. The price is why I bumped it up to 5 stars.

"613","chair","Flash Furniture Kale High Back Dark Gray Mesh Spine-Back Ergonomic Drafting Chair with Adjustable Foot Ring and Adjustable Flip-Up Arms","PlanMan","I bought the drafting chair to go with my standing desk (Varidesk). The raise and lower piston action is smooth although the chair sinks about an inch when I load it by sitting.The footrest will not stay in place. I'm tall enough that having it at the bottom of its range is fine. But others have complained and I have found it will not stay put for long above the bottom of its range for long, regardless how tight you turn the adjustment knob.The arms swing out of the way nicely although the left arm is slightly misaligned compared to the right one. It's a bit higher. The mesh fabric feels well made and allows plenty of ventilation which is a nice feature of this type of material.Assembly is easy and without any problems. The chair was packed well and arrived undamaged.At $200 plus tax its worth it principally because of how comfortable it is and the functionality a tall adjustable chair provides for those of us using it with a standing desk.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Well packed - not a scratch or scuff I could find.Wheels aren't great, immediately got upgraded to the rollerblade style, seemed to slide more than roll with the stock set.For a 6'2 big guy - it's pretty comfortable, but I wish I could move the backrest back about an inch / 1.5"" just so the seat booster was farther forward than it currently is. But compared to most - I'm definitely not complaining - way better for the big/tall types than most of the ergo chairs.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 2 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It is perfect for my sit/stand desk.  The only thing I wish it had was a head rest - which I never thought I needed.  However, I think maybe it's out of habit but I leaned back and went whoa - there's no headrest, haha.  But again, no biggie.  I love the lower back support and the seat.  It's perfect.  I'm a small frame / short person (5' 1"") and this chair is a perfect fit.  I really love it.  It also looks nice and was well made.  I did end up making one modification, I added different wheels.  Similar to roller blades and it eliminated my need to have a floor mat which I really loved.  Again, I haven't had this chair long so I can not attest to longevity, but initial impression are an A.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 April 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"619","chair","Flash Furniture Kale High Back Dark Gray Mesh Spine-Back Ergonomic Drafting Chair with Adjustable Foot Ring and Adjustable Flip-Up Arms","Hardhead7525","I am loving my chair for my work from home patio office.  We had a countertop height work station built that doubles as a casual eating surface.  My chair is just the right height.  I love it that the arms fold up.  It is supremely comfortable and seemingly well built. I always wait 30 days before reviewing to make sure that my first impressions are validated and withstand the (short) test of time.  My only minor quibble is that the chair sinks a couple of inches when my 250lbs nestle in the seat.  That may be an issue for some but I am at just the right height for my table.  If it was a high top I may need an inch or 2 more height.  No issues with the foot rest but I bought a small VIVO foot rest that works perfectly and is just the thing when you want to stretch your legs out during long work sessions.  I recommend it highly.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I‚Äôve had two major back surgeries and in line for a third one. I am an artist and have had great difficulty sitting at my art table for longer than an hour with my previous chair. This chair has changed all that! It is super comfortable in the seat cushion area and the adjustable arm rest are equally comfortable. Because of my back issues I added two lumbar pillows, as you can see in the two included photos I‚Äôve attached.  I placed one high and one low. This puts me as close to a 90 degree setting position and is the only way I can sit without lower back pain. I have this same set up in my office chair and car seat. Needless to say, adding the lumbar pillows is in no way a direct reflection of this chairs already comfortable nature. It would certainly be comfortable without any additions. I am a special case, with pre-existing conditions. Those of you with back problems will already understand the importance of finding a comfortable seat that won‚Äôt aggravate your back further. What I needed most out of my search for a new chair was, 1). Must be well built, 2). Must be comfortable for an extended period of time and lastly, 3). Must have adequate height adjustability for my tall art table. This chair has delivered all those requirements in spades and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!

Overall it's a fantastic chair - comfortable, arms can go up/down as well as fold back, foot rest is adjustable, and wheels work smoothly. However the seat cushion smells horribly of mold/mildew. I'm not sure what happened, the box was bone dry but the seat cushion just fills my room up with awful smell and even lingers on my clothes when I leave the room. I tried white vinegar but it didn't work, now it just smells vaguely like vinegar but still entirely like mold. Reached out to the manufacturer's email, no response.

I know that it's still under the return period, but do I really want to disassemble it and send it back? I already threw away the boxes.UPDATE: May 5, 2023: The creaking noise is getting louder and more frequent.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 April 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Regular desk chairs are usually lower, and drafting chairs are usually higher.  This one fits the bill for me.  I did not install the foot ring as it was unnecessary for my seat height.  The only reason I didn't give it overall five stars is the mesh back.  I prefer a fully padded one but this seems to be the way most chairs come these days.

My chair looks like new.  When I went to buy a computer chair before I bought this one, I did lots of research and thought that I needed to find a $500+ chair if I was going to have a chair that would last for more than a couple years - but for whatever reason this chair has held up wonderfully - so lucky, so grateful.

Personally love it, very easy to assemble, nice material, comfortable, ect. Used super saver shipping and it got here in 4 days so that's $40 you don't have to spend. Also I would like to add I initially planned to buy a chair at Staples but not only did they not have any associates in the store except for at customer service they also didn't have their advertised chair I wanted to buy.  After that I said well I'll check out Office Max. After making my choice following 10 minutes of browsing the chairs without so much as a hello I went to the register with the slip for my choice and 15 minutes later I still didn't have a chair.  So I left and bought this one.  It took me 3 tries but I eventually made the right choice.

They didn't. Most of the bolt holes were off just enough to require some extra effort to get them lined up. The arms were another story. One arm went on reasonably easy, but for the second one the bolt holes were misaligned, AND pointing in the wrong direction. I had to get the first bolt partially into the crooked receiving threads and then use the leverage of the chair arm to bring it into line and insert the second bolt. I was quite impressed that the crooked receiving threads didn't break off their anchor point inside the chair back, because I had to bend it enough to bring the arm's bottom anchor point up about 4 inches to get it lined up.I probably should have sent it back, but I was tired of shopping for chairs, and it;s a whole lot better than the ancient piece of junk I had.The chair is as comfortable as one can expect for a hundred bucks, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend because of the horrid manufacturing tolerances.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 1 May 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Also, the seat padding is thin and after hours of sitting in it (I am 155 lbs) it looks like the seat has been flattened from years of use.  It also has no tilt on the chair but it probably is very good for someone who needs good lumbar support.  The lumbar support is better than most chairs for the price.

Well, the only thing to say is that it is a beautiful color chair.  The assembly part was not that easy to do.  Everything was fine until I got to the arm handles.  They would not fit no matter which way the arms were positioned.  The screw holes do not line up and therefore are useless.  The product was made in China so that should tell you everything right there.  Flash furniture has a nice variety of different chairs to choose from but they are not well built. On a side note, the box arrived damaged and the packets that are supposed to keep it fresh were busted all over the inside.  So when I took out the parts, all these little beads rolled onto the floor which is dangerous for the family pets.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 August 2016","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Received the parts today andmade the ""repairs"" to the chair in about five minutes.

On the third day, after sitting in it for a couple of hours, the foam where my butt goes was totally crushed and it was like like sitting in a board. The foam on the exact spot where my arms rested on the arm rests was totally crushed in the same way. The rest of the foam on the seat and arm rests where was not much pressure or no pressure is just fine. The crushed areas of the foam recover and seem normal the next day but it doesn't hold up top prolonged sitting. I'm 6 ft and weigh 210. If you weigh 40 or more pounds less, it might be just fine for you but I would not recommend this chair.I'm trying to disassemble it for return shipping but the pneumatic tube may be impossible to separate from the seat and bottom so I miight not be able to get it back in the box.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Langley","I gave it five stars because I like it and can find no fault with it. I bought it to replace a much less expensive chair that broke at 3 years and six months of use, and had a warranty of exactly 3 years. The major difference between the two chairs is that this one has a more solid construction. The back is attached to the seat with a large (basically) L shaped bracket that takes the pressure of my back  and will surely hold up much longer than the previous chair's construction. That other chair's back was only supported by the attachment of the arms, and it was the arms that broke because of that.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 24 December 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars"

They fit well with a similar TV stand that I bought. I thought it would be nice to put ferns on them to green up the space. I had accidentally over watered one and had a small puddle of of water seep through the bottom of the pot. I noticed this within 5 minutes of setting the plant down and quickly cleaned everything up. That 5 minutes was enough to do considerable damage to the table. It seems like the water cause the adhesive to come undone and possible the particle board to expand. It's not dry and there's nothing I can do about it now. It's not the end of the world and I'm still going to use the table but overall is a testimate to how cheaply these made.

I think they look much nicer than all of the dozens of styles of dedicated pedestal speaker stands I've seen at similar or higher price points. Much easier and less commitment than wall mounted shelves, too.Gave only 3 stars for sturdiness as this is a point of concern that buyers should be aware of. The legs are made of plastic, so the 15 lb. weight limit should not be tested. That being said, they still feel quite sturdy and had no more noticeable wobble or flex than steel or wood legs in a similar design.2 of the 8 couplings embedded in the wood tops were a little loose, and rotate when tightening the legs down. This is easily fixed with a bit of glue, if any concern, but with 3 other legs on each being very tight I saw no need.As long as you're not depending on these for anything heavy, fragile, or valuable, they should serve you fine.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2021","2.0 out of 5 stars"

They were super easy to assemble. It was also heavier than anticipated which was a bonus. The tables are very sturdy, and had no scratches or any damage to either side of the laminated tops or the pressed wood bottoms. The legs are plastic and literally screw into the top and bottom levels of the table. The bottom feet are also made from the same thick plastic. It took me about 5-7 min to assemble the two tables. The tables are about a 12x12 with rounded edges. The tables are about 20 inches in height. I would definitely recommend these side tables and will probably order another set for my classroom.

They're steady, and look reasonably nice. A couple minor issues to point out:* They came slightly scuffed and fairly dusty.* Assembly is tool free, if you don't count a book as a tool. You need to push in some plastic bits, and it requires a good bit of force. A hammer would be ideal, but you can make do with a book and the palm of your hand. Just don't expect grandma to be able to put it together.* Some rubber feet would be nice. I get this is the budget end, so you can't expect much, but that'd be a nice way to up the quality of the product.""Fits space.

I have purchased cheaper sets that have been higher quality but my daughter wanted this badly so I chose not to return it.  A lot of stains and scuffing right out of the box on the drawer assembly parts. All the parts had scratch marks or chips on them in at least a few spots.  The assembly was fine until the D screws at the end, they just didn't line up. I ended up having to leave them out because they just weren't long enough or threaded correctly.  Also, if you're going to require a Philips head screw driver for more than half the assembly, you may as well make all the screws universal rather than split it to have some screws that fit only the allen wrench. Cute but annoying and I'm not sure if I should have spent as much on it as I did.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 1 September 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The first page with the list of components and parts was A OK! No complaints, but oh my god the other side was a hellish ordeal. The assembly instruction page was printed onto the components/parts page UPSIDE DOWN!! And I can‚Äôt forget to mention that there was a bunch of parts/screws and the wording was tiny! Trying to decipher what image/word went with what page was exhausting, and I seriously wanted to gouge my eyes out!! I think I went half blind at some point from straining my eyes. Sorry about the pics. The instructions are wrinkled because I clearly took out my frustrations on them. Anyway for looks I give it a 5! Sturdiness a 4 because one of the sides came with a little chip in the corner. Overall I‚Äôm happy with the purchase.

One of the tables came with two corners dented, the other one came heavily damage, and had to return. The wood part on top gets very easily damage. So please becareful.

I weigh 160, which is way below the max capacity, and more than the computer equipment I will be placing on it.  So as soon as I unpacked it, I lied down on it (better to test it when I can still return it, if it fails).  There is a little wobbling, as there would be with ANY folding table.  But I felt nice and secure.  It was about $10 more than a comparable table.  But the extra $10 is worth the nicer ""wood look"" finish on the plastic top.  When set up, there is no sagging in the middle that I can see, even with the compuer equipment on the table.  Finally, the legs only have one horizontal bar towards the top (no ""X"" bars, no bar at the bottom).  So it is easier for someone to sit at the ends of the table, if needed,.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 July 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The first table came with a puncture. While in a corner, I still preferred undamaged goods. This vendor was quick to replace my purchase. I find the adjustable legs to be a great feature. I had it lower so I could sit at my sofa. Since getting the table, though, I use it as a secondary desk, so I haven't had to constantly adjust the height. I don't overly abuse it but I do have 3 stacks of 2"" files, a 4"" stack of magazines and a metal file holder with 6 files. The table seems to be holding up well with no visible buckling. I've dismantled it once, and the handle was a nice feature too. I was also looking for a simulated wood table top, which this is. The cost was an important consideration.

I got the double pack that had white and black shelves. You can actually do both the same if you want which I didn‚Äôt realize. The black has white on the opposite side and same with the white. Which I really liked.I put them both together in less than 5 minutes. Very simple. Just twist the poles in. No tools required. Obviously the plastic poles aren‚Äôt great quality but it doesn‚Äôt affect the stand at all and really doesn‚Äôt look bad like I anticipated. I will say I prefer the all white because it looks better but I also wanted the black for a boys room. I do wish the one came with black poles!  But it can easily be changed back so I may do that if I don‚Äôt like it. I will be buying more of these for around the house!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 3 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Discovered the kit had 2 bolts missing from the hardware kit.  I notified the company & they responded by mailing me a new packet of hardware components in a timely manner.  Kudos to them.I liked the product so well, that I purchased a 2nd unit for our spare room, where it acts as a stand for our laptop computer, with the drawer a handy place to put printer paper and other office odds & ends.  The style is so compatible with the existing desk & printer stand, that my husband didn't even notice its placement.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 6 November 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I felt like assembling it was just like Ikea but better because there are plastic threads in the holes for the screws that pull the wood together with the big circle screw latchy thing.The only thing that I'm disappointed about is that the drawer doesn't pull out on rails, and depends on a metal hook thing that hangs from the top side to stop the drawer from sliding out all the way. Because of this, I'd say that it isn't very smooth to slide the drawer and I would have thought for $100 each that it'd be on rails. I gave it 4 stars for that reason.

Si buscas unos soportes baratos, seguro que encontrar√°s alternativas... pero si lo que quieres es hacerte con unos soportes de calidad, y este tipo de producto suele durar pr√°cticamente de por vida, creo que no vas a encontrar nada mejor. Ni siquiera apostando por modelos con un precio m√°s abultado, que los hay. ¬øPor qu√© me atrevo a afirmar algo as√≠? Te lo cuento a continuaci√≥n.- Lo primero que llama la atenci√≥n es el peso del soporte, factor importante para garantizar estabilidad (y supongo que maximizar la absorci√≥n de vibraciones). El acero se hace notar.- Los acabados son magn√≠ficos, cosa que siempre se agradece.- Vienen ya montados (olv√≠date de quebraderos de cabeza por tornillos que se van aflojando con el paso del tiempo) y lo √∫nico que tendr√°s que hacer es colocar los topes adhesivos de goma en la ubicaci√≥n id√≥nea (se incluyen cuatro grandes para la base y cuatro m√°s peque√±os para la plataforma, sobre los que se coloca cada monitor).- Es posible fijar la altura con total libertad gracias a la palomilla (nada de posiciones fijas que siempre son una limitaci√≥n).- La estabilidad es soberbia (a prueba de torpes y de casi cualquier visicitud, salvo fuerza mayor).Este dise√±o tiene dos grandes virtudes (al margen de que est√©ticamente gusten m√°s o menos): te va a permitir que aproveches el espacio que queda bajo los monitores (cosa importante porque el espacio de escritorio suele escasear) y, adem√°s, este tipo de plataforma ""al aire"" disipa parte de las vibraciones... los topes de goma se encargan del resto).En cuanto al tama√±o, he colocado unos monitores M-Audio AV40 Studiofile y van de lujo. En primer lugar, la diferencia en el sonido al ubicarlos a una altura adecuada es evidente (no hace falta ser ning√∫n audi√≥filo para detectarlo, te lo aseguro); en segundo lugar, el desacople es perfecto. No vas a necesitar pads de aislamiento adicionales (los t√≠picos de espuma) ni nada similar.En resumen, yo no he encontrado nada mejor y volver√≠a a comprar estos soportes sin dudarlo ni un segundo. Son robustos, pr√°cticos y cumplen su funci√≥n a las mil maravillas. ¬øQui√©n da m√°s?","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 7 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

S√≠, efectivamente son muy robustos y al menos aguantan bien el peso de mis Yamaha MSP5, que no son precisamente ligeros. Lo soportes pesan un mont√≥n y se nota su calidad de construcci√≥n con tan solo cogerlos.Sin embargo hay que tener en cuenta que no poseen ning√∫n mecanismo ni a√±adido para regular la inclinaci√≥n de los monitores, con lo que esto debe correr a cargo ellos o de cualquier otro accesorio que se nos ocurra.Lo que me gusta especialmente de estos soportes, aparte de su robustez, es que dejan toda la parte inferior libre, con lo que podemos usarla para a√±adir a√∫n m√°s trastos a la mesa (yay!).En resumen, muy contento con la compra y por el precio est√°n genial. Cuestan menos de lo que pesan.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 21 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Amazing Product, much better than all the cheaper and even more expensive plastic ones around on the market.One word of notice, its not the pair of stands, so you have to buy 2 of this product if you want a pair.

Been using them for a few months now and I'm very happy with their quality. They are sturdy and I'm not scared of them being unable to handle my KRK6s. The sound isolation also appears to be good, as it noticeably reduced the boomy/boxy-ness of my monitors (after being on the desk) and allowed for more of the dynamics to be heard.The only downside to these is the cost, but compared to what else is available right now they are a good value.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 October 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The idea of C table is amazing, only if i can pull it close to me. But since my l-zy boy base is not hollow to slide anything under, I‚Äôll have to keep the table on my side. The older style tray table is usually bamboo color, and although functional, they look out of date for my taste. But C table looks more modern, but cost twice the price. So finding this tray table that look more modern, came in 2 for the price of 1 C table sounds like a good deal to me. It looks really good next to my couch, and DH got his as well, is a win win for me. Assembling was easy, came with everything needed, including the screwdriver, and it feels sturdy but not too heavy, The cup holder is ok, good concept and hold my not so heavy cup fine, but it‚Äôs not drilled to the table and slides easy.

I noticed the lower back support right away. I was due for a new chair and bought the black version for myself a couple months later. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and 205 lbs. The cushion is soft and firm. The height is just right with out using the leveler handle to raise it at all. The arm handles  raise up and down which is nice when I‚Äôm not using the chair to push it all the way into my desk.I started by mounting the bracket to the bottom of the seat. Then I screwed the arm handles to the back part of the seat first. After that I installed the bottom seat to the handles. Lastly I put the wheels one the base and covers/caps to the arm handles following the cylinder. Don‚Äôt forget the cylinder caps before you mount it to the chair. I did the first time around and had to hammer the base out with a towel to avoid damage to uninstall. Easy to assemble & took about 20/30minutes each time. Includes a hex key tool for the screws.Some people mention having a hard time aligning the screws with the holes but I just pressed down firmly when lined up and had no issues for both chairs. Each screw went in all the way to make contact then I tightened all of them when everything was aligned correctly. If you tighten each one right away, it can be uneven or slightly off when assembled.Price at this time is $131.83 and I bought it for $114.69 with a 20% coupon that was offered on the page.

¬†Pagata circa 65‚Ç¨ con Amazon seconda mano, completamente nuova visto che aveva solo la scatola originale rotta (molto rotta).Montarla √® stato un po' ostico perch√© bisogna fare attenzione a non avvitare tutto direttamente perch√© a quel punto diventa difficile stringere. √à necessario inserire tutte le viti centrandole di modo che i pezzi non si spostino. L'ho testata 3 giorni prima di scrivere ma aggiorner√≤ la recensione pi√π avanti.Pro:- arriva con gi√† tutto l'occorrente (non c'√® bisogno di un cacciavite)- comoda e facilmente regolabile in altezza- la retina dietro la schiena permette un miglior passaggio dell'ariaContro:- servizio di spedizione carente (spiego meglio pi√π avanti, non so se fosse relativo a warehouse)- la pelle mi sembra sintetica e non so quanto durer√† (sono vegetariana e a me va benissimo il fatto che sia sintetica)- a prezzo pieno non so se vale 170‚Ç¨ (prezzo attuale)Non so quanto durer√†.Dico che la spedizione ha fatto pena perch√© Amazon si √® appoggiato a poste italiane che a sua volta si √® appoggiato a un terzo servizio di spedizioni piuttosto discutibile:- Il pacco √® arrivato con un buco e un pezzo di sedia che SPORGEVA fuori, inevitabilmente danneggiando la base dell'articolo.- il corriere mi ha chiamato al telefono anzich√© suonare al citofono e io non ho potuto rispondere subito, a quel punto non ha nemmeno suonato al citofono e ha DECISO ARBITRARIAMENTE che io non ci fossi quindi √® andato via. Dopo 5 minuti ho visto la chiamata persa, l'ho richiamato e mi ha detto di aver suonato (bugia clamorosa) e che era gi√† fuori citt√† quindi sarebbe passato domani (impossibile perch√© in 5 minuti a malapena esci dal mio quartiere).Ho ricevuto la sedia per miracolo solo perch√© a quanto pare in chiamata devo esser apparsa molto scocciata e perch√© palesemente in 5 minuti il camion era dietro l'angolo. üòÖ Mi auguro che se la comprate nuova almeno ci sia un servizio migliore per il prezzo pagato.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 8 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Maybe it is because I have been assembling a ton of furniture lately and it is always super annoying, frustrating and time-consuming. Regardless of my reason, I just did NOT want to do it.Today, I finally faced my fears and opened the box and WOW. This was the easiest to assemble piece of furniture ever!1. The hardware and bolts, etc. were already pre-sorted and organized into a blister pack-like cardboard holder and nicely labelled, so all you need is a scissor to open that pack when you get to that part of the instructions.2. The directions were fool proof--super clear and easy to follow with sufficient diagrams and well written text.3. All tools included (just an allen wrench).I finished assembling it in 20 minutes, which is pretty much a miracle for me.Time will tell how solid this chair is...so far it is pretty comfy and I added an additional lumbar pillow for more support. It wheels easily and is easy to raise and lower.However, I can absolutely recommend this chair if you want frustration-free assembly!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The tilt lock mechanism was dodgy and the overall tilt leaves you leaning too far back.  The mesh material also does not look durable and had stretch creases after a single sit.  The coasters (I kid you not) were such poor quality that they would not roll at all, and instead drag across the floor.  Some bolts  also do not fit correctly into the holes.  I had to use an impact hammer drill to get them to screw in.  All of the issues I experienced have been reported in other reviews, so I doubt our experience is a one off.

Packaged well, delivered on time.  It was very easily put together and is a really nice looking item .  However,  it has serious issues and I deeply regret this purchase. Its seat padding has sunk very quickly and imm constantly sliding off it as a result, the seat consistently drops to its lowest height setting  Somehow the back lumber support arch is too high, its very uncomfortable indeed.

"1715","chair","Flash Furniture Whitney High Back Desk Chair - Black LeatherSoft Executive Swivel Office Chair with Black Frame - Swivel Arm Chair","T SchaScha","I ordered this office chair as I needed a new one and decided to go with the white/gold to match my desk. Although the gold on the chair and my desk are two different finishes of gold, it has a bit of a chic-like look and feel to it.I know many of the reviews say this chair is very easy to assemble but it‚Äôs more like semi-easy-ish. While understanding the parts and having the knowledge of assembling the chair, it‚Äôs not as easy to assemble if you‚Äôre doing it by yourself. Many of the screw placement holes don‚Äôt fully align correctly so you have to use force to manually align your parts to each hole in order to successfully drill all of your screws in tightly. Assembly time is much slower when using a manual Allen wrench so I suggest using a powered one instead as it‚Äôs more efficient.It‚Äôs a comfortable chair and I personally like the straight back support it gives me. I have read reviews that the chair will decline in quality after heavy use but unless you are jumping on this thing, I don‚Äôt think the wear and tear will happen. I can‚Äôt say the same for the faux leather element because we just never know.Overall, it‚Äôs not a bad chair for the price. I would recommend it for yourself.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

    ¬†seemed to be a good choice, as I wanted to try a mesh-back chair, primarily for breathability in the summer. Also didn't want a chair with any arms, as they get in the way with my personal work habits.The chair arrived in under 48 hours (thanks, Amazon Prime), and was boxed very well. The the assembly directions were reasonably clear, and it took less than half an hour to put together with the included Allen wrench. The five included caster wheels were perhaps the most difficult part of the assembly, but with a bit of wiggling they all slipped in. Fiddled with the pneumatic seat height adjustment for a few minutes, and I had a work chair.After a few weeks of use, I can make a few observations. The mesh back turned out to be more comfortable than I expected, and no wonder many like them. It not only breathes, but the support is quite good, even after hours. But... the ""2-inch Thick Padded Mesh Seat"" as stated in the product description is the thinnest two inches that I've ever encountered in a chair. Maybe it would be better if a more dense foam had been used. Will probably be looking for a supplementary seat pad at some point.If you're looking for a reasonably-priced chair that's similar and has arms, the¬†

If you need to be in it for multiple hours you should look into getting an additional support cushion.

Obviously they aren't as comfortable as my office chair which cost 10x as much, but for the price they are great.The wheels aren't great on carpet, but you can easily move the chairs around when empty but don't expect to be able to zoom around an office in the chair. The rotation works very well. The height adjustment works fine, so that people of different heights can sit happily. The back mesh is much more comfortable than I expected, and you can lean against the back quite happily. The seat is about what I expected for the price (good, but not the best).The chairs are very easy to put together after you've done it once, and can be done in about 10 minutes (the only tool you need is provided). The first time I found it a little hard to distinguish between the seat and the back on the instructions, so that one maybe took twice as long.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 April 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars"

What I like a lot:  It's small, and adjusts to a height low enough to comfortably sit at my sewing table.  The seat is well padded, and the back ergonomically built to allow me to sew comfortably for hours.  I'm under 5' and weigh under a 100 lbs. so this chair is perfect for me. I looked at a lot of chairs and decided on this one because it is simple, straightforward, basic.  I would have liked to buy the Amazon basic chair but, alas, it was too big and did not adjust low enough for me.  This is a perfect basic chair for petite persons.

The chair had to hold at least 300 lbs and be under $200.  After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this chair and I am happy I did.  It arrived pretty quickly and with minimal outside box damage.  Everything was wrapped nicely.  I arranged everything on the floor and double checked I received everything I was supposed to.  Once that process was done, it took me probably 40 minutes total to put the chair together.  I'm sure it would take some people less time but I'm not accustomed to putting things together so I'm probably really slow.  I realized towards the end of assembly that the back plastic piece that clicks onto the back, had a broken clasp.  I then proceeded to plug in the ""massage"" portion of the chair to see if it worked - I knew going into this that the massage feature was hit or miss with some people.  It barely worked.  I then contacted Amazon to ask about a replacement back plastic piece and massage unit.  Unfortunately the ONLY option you have is to do a full chair replacement - they could not just send parts.  I explained that the entire chair was assembled at this point and I had no intention of taking it apart so they offered me a $35 credit.  Since my main concern was a chair, and It appeared I now had a decent one, I took the credit.  The back plastic piece clicked on anyway as there are several other notches.  On to the chair itself.  I usually sit down in the morning around 7:30am and work until 6pm.  I might get up every few hours (not nearly enough), but for the most part I live in this chair for 10 hours a day.  For a chair under $200, this is a very decent chair.  By 3pm, my underside starts to hurt a bit but it's certainly better than what I was sitting in before.  The arms adjust, the height adjusts, it has decent lumbar support if you sit back in it.  You can feel the massage unit slightly when you sit back but nothing that hinders me from doing so.  At first I was slightly disappointed because I was comparing the comfort of this chair to the one in my physical office (pre pandemic) but realized that you cannot compare a $500 chair with a $150 chair.  If you have to stay within a budget under $200 and need a ""plus size"" chair, this is the one.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It wasn't in the write-up, but there is also a mysterious USB cable interface to your PC for ""massage control""??

Perfect time to upgrade right? I'm around 330 lbs so well under the max limit for the chair.Put this together today after receiving it. First warning sign was that one of the stickers was damaged/half-ripped (the FRONT sticker on the seat) showing me this is a refurb despite being told it was new. Also one of the permanent screws that comes pre-attached to the part that goes on the bottom of the chair and links with the gas mechanism looked super crooked. One item that according to the install guide wasn't supposed to already be attached was attached (the cover for the part where all of the wheels combine) so clearly someone had already had this. The packaging it came in was partially ripped. So yeah, even though they sell ""new"" these are 100% refurbs.Whatever, I still put it together alone without major issue and decide to sit on it. Quickly noticed that this wasn't near as comfortable as the similar chair I had at my office. I had known it would have less features (the one I had at the office let you move the seat forward/backward easily and had a very easy to use reclining feature that you could lock in any position but I was aware this one didn't have the first feature; it also had an easy adjustment to move the arms closer/further to the chair that this does not have, you need to unscrew and rescrew the arm to make an adjustment).It's wide, that's great and no complaint there. The chair goes up and down fine. The arms are good although because they are slightly loose to allow you to move them up and down they make a minor clacking noise if you touch them. Nothing major and mostly expected. The reclining feature barely works, it seems like the chair will break if I use it and makes a weird noise. I tried to turn the lock on it to the max both sides and it doesn't seem to have an impact.So it's a mediocre chair already, but why a 1?Literally within 2 minutes of sitting on this chair I started getting back pain, and that's sitting in the optimal position too, after adjusting the back part (to the best of my ability, I wish I could just remove the pillow completely because no position was 100% comfortable). Now, I haven't had back pain in a very long time, and I don't have chronic back pain at all. This came out of nowhere. I decided to give it a chance... it is a new chair, maybe I just needed to adjust. I tried to move around on the chair and if I don't sit in a perfect sitting position (IE if I shift forward and lay back a bit) the pain amplifies 200% so that's a no go. Well, it is an office chair so ok that sucks but what after 30 minutes later? The back pain was way worse and I had to give up at that point.I'm now back with my old beat up chair letting my lower back heal up. I've never returned an Amazon product before but I may very well do so for this chair... I'm shocked it has such a high rating. I didn't pay too much attention to the rating though as I know it's not always the end-all-be-all. I mostly thought this would be a good chair based on specifications + my experience with a model that looked similar, but it isn't even close to as comfortable. I wish I could find that exact model...Lesson learned, I will never buy a chair online again.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 30 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It was nice for just under a year. :( Then parts of it started breaking, ripping, tearing, coming apart... and getting very, very, very uncomfortable.Last night I tightened the screws again - maybe the sixth time since I got it - because it was squeaky and feeling very loose when I'm seated. None of the screws solved that issue. A couple were maybe one quarter turn loose, but none of them are what is causing this beast to squeak like a giant rat every time I move. The seat wobbles side to side, like it's breaking underneath. I've heard a couple sounds that sure sound like metal fracturing, but can't see where that's happening and nothing else I can tighten or change to make it comfortable again.The foam in the seat has completely worn out. It's flattened beyond flat. That happened relatively quickly for a chair rated to hold up to 400 lbs. Now there's a rectangle area the size of the seat support underneath that is very firmly raising up through the foam seat. This is making my hip joints and tail bone ache. A coccyx cushion helps a little, but then I'm up too high and it makes the back of my thighs hurt to sit that high, and I don't fit under the keyboard drawer either.It's always something. *sigh* I had high hopes for this chair.A month ago the rubber material on my right arm rest (or whatever it's made from) tore. Just flat out TORE. I had to duct tape it because no glue I have (and I have quite a few different types of permanent glue) would hold rubber to rubber. I've never had an armrest tear before.Maybe I shoulda tried rubber cement. Ha. Anyhow... it's duct taped. It is very scratchy to my right forearm and elbow, so there's a cloth tied over the arm rest. Looks quite ""THERE I FIXED IT!"" now. There's no way to buy just an arm rest, but with the infernal squeaking and the foam seat's demise, this chair's going to be relegated to the seldom-used category: the basement. Or the garage maybe. All it's good for now is doing a little bit of laundry for five minutes here or there.  I can't sit on this for my work-at-home job anymore. :(I'd really hoped I'd get at least 4-5 years of use out of this chair, but I barely made it the first year until it all started going wrong. I gave it 2 stars initially because it WAS easy to assemble, and for a while it was comfortable - maybe 8-10 months. Now I've edited to 1 star. The chair's seat is tilting forward with no way to get it to tilt back again. If I sit on it, I feel like I'm sliding off the seat forward. If I look at the chair from the side, it's very obvious that whatever the material (what is it, particle board?) is bending downwards on the front. Eventually, this chair will break in the seat and I'd wind up on the floor. :( I've tried adjusting the tilt knob underneath but nothing changes - tight, loose, all the same (to the chair, that is). There's a locking handle to control IF it tilts backward, but even that does not help. The chair's support is basically GONE. In a year. THAT should not happen. A chair rated as able to hold a heavier person should no way break down in a year. I bought it to replace a chair I'd had for well over 10 years. The back has, of course, tilted forward too, and there is simply no way to adjust that other than removing the back support entirely. There is no ""back tilt mechanism"" since it's screwed into the chair's seat.I wouldn't recommend this chair to anyone over 200 lbs. Keep looking if you're a heavier person. Just my humble opinion.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 October 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It was nice for just under a year. :( Then parts of it started breaking, ripping, tearing, coming apart... and getting very, very, very uncomfortable.Last night I tightened the screws again - maybe the sixth time since I got it - because it was squeaky and feeling very loose when I'm seated. None of the screws solved that issue. A couple were maybe one quarter turn loose, but none of them are what is causing this beast to squeak like a giant rat every time I move. The seat wobbles side to side, like it's breaking underneath. I've heard a couple sounds that sure sound like metal fracturing, but can't see where that's happening and nothing else I can tighten or change to make it comfortable again.The foam in the seat has completely worn out. It's flattened beyond flat. That happened relatively quickly for a chair rated to hold up to 400 lbs. Now there's a rectangle area the size of the seat support underneath that is very firmly raising up through the foam seat. This is making my hip joints and tail bone ache. A coccyx cushion helps a little, but then I'm up too high and it makes the back of my thighs hurt to sit that high, and I don't fit under the keyboard drawer either.It's always something. *sigh* I had high hopes for this chair.A month ago the rubber material on my right arm rest (or whatever it's made from) tore. Just flat out TORE. I had to duct tape it because no glue I have (and I have quite a few different types of permanent glue) would hold rubber to rubber. I've never had an armrest tear before.Maybe I shoulda tried rubber cement. Ha. Anyhow... it's duct taped. It is very scratchy to my right forearm and elbow, so there's a cloth tied over the arm rest. Looks quite ""THERE I FIXED IT!"" now. There's no way to buy just an arm rest, but with the infernal squeaking and the foam seat's demise, this chair's going to be relegated to the seldom-used category: the basement. Or the garage maybe. All it's good for now is doing a little bit of laundry for five minutes here or there.  I can't sit on this for my work-at-home job anymore. :(I'd really hoped I'd get at least 4-5 years of use out of this chair, but I barely made it the first year until it all started going wrong. I gave it 2 stars initially because it WAS easy to assemble, and for a while it was comfortable - maybe 8-10 months. Now I've edited to 1 star. The chair's seat is tilting forward with no way to get it to tilt back again. If I sit on it, I feel like I'm sliding off the seat forward. If I look at the chair from the side, it's very obvious that whatever the material (what is it, particle board?) is bending downwards on the front. Eventually, this chair will break in the seat and I'd wind up on the floor. :( I've tried adjusting the tilt knob underneath but nothing changes - tight, loose, all the same (to the chair, that is). There's a locking handle to control IF it tilts backward, but even that does not help. The chair's support is basically GONE. In a year. THAT should not happen. A chair rated as able to hold a heavier person should no way break down in a year. I bought it to replace a chair I'd had for well over 10 years. The back has, of course, tilted forward too, and there is simply no way to adjust that other than removing the back support entirely. There is no ""back tilt mechanism"" since it's screwed into the chair's seat.I wouldn't recommend this chair to anyone over 200 lbs. Keep looking if you're a heavier person.

Perfect time to upgrade right? I'm around 330 lbs so well under the max limit for the chair.Put this together today after receiving it. First warning sign was that one of the stickers was damaged/half-ripped (the FRONT sticker on the seat) showing me this is a refurb despite being told it was new. Also one of the permanent screws that comes pre-attached to the part that goes on the bottom of the chair and links with the gas mechanism looked super crooked. One item that according to the install guide wasn't supposed to already be attached was attached (the cover for the part where all of the wheels combine) so clearly someone had already had this. The packaging it came in was partially ripped. So yeah, even though they sell ""new"" these are 100% refurbs.Whatever, I still put it together alone without major issue and decide to sit on it. Quickly noticed that this wasn't near as comfortable as the similar chair I had at my office. I had known it would have less features (the one I had at the office let you move the seat forward/backward easily and had a very easy to use reclining feature that you could lock in any position but I was aware this one didn't have the first feature; it also had an easy adjustment to move the arms closer/further to the chair that this does not have, you need to unscrew and rescrew the arm to make an adjustment).It's wide, that's great and no complaint there. The chair goes up and down fine. The arms are good although because they are slightly loose to allow you to move them up and down they make a minor clacking noise if you touch them. Nothing major and mostly expected. The reclining feature barely works, it seems like the chair will break if I use it and makes a weird noise. I tried to turn the lock on it to the max both sides and it doesn't seem to have an impact.So it's a mediocre chair already, but why a 1?Literally within 2 minutes of sitting on this chair I started getting back pain, and that's sitting in the optimal position too, after adjusting the back part (to the best of my ability, I wish I could just remove the pillow completely because no position was 100% comfortable). Now, I haven't had back pain in a very long time, and I don't have chronic back pain at all. This came out of nowhere. I decided to give it a chance... it is a new chair, maybe I just needed to adjust. I tried to move around on the chair and if I don't sit in a perfect sitting position (IE if I shift forward and lay back a bit) the pain amplifies 200% so that's a no go. Well, it is an office chair so ok that sucks but what after 30 minutes later? The back pain was way worse and I had to give up at that point.I'm now back with my old beat up chair letting my lower back heal up. I've never returned an Amazon product before but I may very well do so for this chair... I'm shocked it has such a high rating. I didn't pay too much attention to the rating though as I know it's not always the end-all-be-all. I mostly thought this would be a good chair based on specifications + my experience with a model that looked similar, but it isn't even close to as comfortable. I wish I could find that exact model...Lesson learned, I will never buy a chair online again.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 30 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Just my humble opinion.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 October 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They both really like the fit and comfort level of the chair.  The height adjustable feature works great, and the arm rests are also very adjustable, both up and down and they move closer/farther from the seat horizontally.  The seat cushion is very thick, so the height adjust feature is important for shorter individuals.  Price is very good for the quality of the product.

I didn't have a lot of money to spend on an office chair, but I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. I currently don't have any back issues or pains while sitting, and using this chair has not given me any.Assembly was easy and the directions were clear. As with just about anything it could've been easier with another person to hold pieces in place while the other works with the tools, but I managed to get everything together correctly the first time in 15 minutes.The only thing that was a little different was the color. The grey in the photo is noticeably lighter than what you actually receive. So the grey that looks lighter and is almost a light white is actually more of a light charcoal.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 November 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"1918","chair","Flash Furniture Low Back Designer Armless White Ribbed Swivel Task Office Chair","francesco","I was worried that this chair, as thin as it was, would be uncomfortable.  But it provides cushion and support at all the necessary places, especially the lower back, without looking like a couch.  I got the chair in white, and it really is a lovely piece of furniture for only $80.  The height is easily adjustable while sitting on it, using the lever under the seat.  The chair took just a few minutes to assemble; there were only 4 screws to screw in, using the allen wrench that came with it.  The vinyl is super soft, which makes me wonder how durable it will be, but for $80, if it gets a rip, I'll just buy a new chair!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 22 June 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The screws had loctite on them. Are you kidding me, nobody does that, they usuall  leave us to forgo an essential ingredient when tightening things up. The protective packaging was hand tight not requiring anything that would draw blood.  The instructions were black and white drawings that were informative. The tool for installing had the correct length and leverage to ensure the correct torque would/could be applied. The bolt heads that are not visible have caps available to clean things up. Just an example of how well this chair has been designed and built. I did have one problem and that was one of the wheel sockets had been slightly compressed and required that I clamp the wheel axle into place. This chair is so comfortable that while I was testing it for comfort I started to nod off.

I usually work standing up and only sit for a few minutes an hour. I like the fact that this chair has a footrest. The chair turns smoothly, and the arms are easily raised. The back support is relatively average but not uncomfortable. The casters work well. The foam used for the chair is relatively comfortable, but I'm afraid the foam will sag over time.The assembly of the chair was relatively easy and quick.***DIMENSION***-The height of the assembled chair:-Back between 42 1/2 and 50 1/2 inches- Armrests between 29 3/4 and 37 3/4 inches-Seat between 21 1/2 and 29 1/2 inches*** IN THE BOX, THERE IS ****-Chair-Installation manual (basic)*** FEATURES ***-The wheels (5) work well-The armrests are easily adjusted-Adjustable and comfortable back support despite being made of plastic-The footrest is interesting-Allows you to do 360 degrees with the chair*** PRODUCT PACKAGING ***-A very standard box****CONCLUSION***Overall, I am relatively happy with the product. I hesitated for a long time before choosing this chair. I was looking for a chair that could be lifted enough to work on my ""sit and stand"" desk when it is up.

"2011","chair","Flash Furniture Mid-Back White Mesh Swivel Ergonomic Task Office Chair with White Frame and Flip-Up Arms","Elena K.","The chair is beautiful to look at, and if you are petite (I'm 5'3) it's the perfect height at almost it's lowest setting so it would still be good if you're a little taller. Your legs are at a good 90 degree angle and the waterfall seat allows circulation behind the knees. I tend to sit cross-legged often and the arms don't get in the way. The seat is firm but comfortable and I like that the arms are padded and can be lifted up to tuck under my desk. They are the perfect height for me leaving my elbows bent at a 90¬∞ angle. The arms are little too far apart from the body though but that's not a deal breaker for me. The lumbar support is not adjustable but hits me at the perfect spot.The reason for the lower rating is because of the price. Like another reviewer, my chair came with the underside of the wheel housing rusty-looking (even though the material is not metal) and it was impossible to get the stains out (maybe I got that chair that they returned). I got an amazon warehouse deal so for what I paid, I decided to keep it as the staining is on the underside of the legs and not visible. The rest of the chair looks great and in great condition. The wheels turn smoothly and it has a good amount of lean back.At $300 though, I would be upset about the staining. I would still give this chair a shot, just look out for the staining and return it if it's there. Otherwise, it's worth it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 31 March 2022","4.3 out of 5 stars"

But after a period something broke and I noticed it was the wood inside the seat.  When I lean back it leans to one side due to this. I truly despise it. The product should be more sustainable. I use it every day and I feel that it was a waste of my investment. Also the arms screws loosen up after weeks and to tighten them I need to open up the chair. Have done it mutiple times now. The backside broke from the seat side due to the pressure of only four bolts bolted in the wooden seat. I contacted the company but never ever received a response.

"2015","chair","Flash Furniture Mid-Back White Mesh Swivel Ergonomic Task Office Chair with White Frame and Flip-Up Arms","Texan","People have said that this chair is difficult to put together, it isn't. That the holes don't line up, they do. That it's not comfortable, it is.The fixing bolts are easily cross-threaded, which is perhaps why people said the holes didn't line up, so if you are putting it together and the bolts feel stiff, don't press your luck, you are probably cross-threading them and this will end badly. Basically, if the bolts don't go in easily, you are doing it wrong. Mind you, be aware that the bolts come with thread lock applied so they will become a little harder to screw in after a few turns, this is normal with thread-lock.So far, the chair has been comfy, not too bad a height and feels sturdy.It's not mentioned anywhere but the seat height is 45cm.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

F√ºr meinen Einsatzzweck im Home-Office aber v√∂llig ausreichend.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 23 April 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2020","chair","Flash Furniture Mid-Back White Mesh Swivel Ergonomic Task Office Chair with White Frame and Flip-Up Arms","Victoria","Was looking for a new chair to replace my old chair from my set-up. I settled on something cheap since I wouldn't need it for took long and wanted something that was better than the last and good looking.I looked at other chairs and some of them just seemed off, the reviews didn't provide a good feeling so I skipped out on them. But whilst browsing the reviews on this chair I couldn't see anything wrong. Some complaints about squeaky parts, hard to assemble and stuff like that. My first impression since I just got it today is that it is a solid and comfy chair that is also stylish.I got the black frame and white mesh option and it fits in great with my room theme. The overall design is pretty neat with decent support for your back and feels pretty normal size. The armrests on nonadjustable but can go up if you wish not to use them. The putting together of the chair may require some help or nifty way but it's no reason to not buy it. My parts mostly aligned and caused no fuss when assembling. I had the thing put together in about 30 mins with a little help. The instructions aren't the best but it's pretty easy to just use your brain to put it together.The feeling of the mesh is soft and breathable. The cushion is nice and padded, the arm rest are very padded a little more for my liking but that is probably because they are new. Overall I rated it a 4/5, certainly was a little above what I was expecting and was happy with the purchase. Good chair for a decent price.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 31 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

For the first few months it was fantastic - the cushion is comfortable, and the mesh back is great if you're the type that gets hot sitting in a leather or faux leather seat for chunks of time.I purchased the chair in July of 2022. It's March of 2023 and I'm already looking for a replacement after just 7ish months of use. I'm certainly below the rated weight limit, and despite that, I started encountering slow-but-consistent issues gradually popping up.The first thing to go was the screw that holds the left armrest in place (pictured). It somehow went straight through the foam-like material and ruined that armrest when I leaned against it. I got an annoying cut from it, but with some repositioning, I was able to get it into a decent enough position to be workable ...until the right armrest screw straight up fell out about a month later.After both armrests had their issues, the mechanism that stops you from leaning back all the way started acting up. As opposed to leaning straight back, it now leans back and to the side in a way that makes you feel like it will topple at any moment.Finally, and the straw that broke the camel's back this week, was the lift function stopping. You can lift the chair as high as it will go, and then very slowly sink back down to its lowest point while you're sitting. I'm glad to have an adjustable desk that I can lower to fit the chair's lowest point while I shop for a new one, but my desk is now at knee height, which isn't super fun.Considering the price, I shouldn't have had super high expectations - you get what you pay for. At the same time, it would have been nice to last at least a year? Instead I got a little over half a year of experiencing a new problem popping out of the blue to surprise me each month.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The assembly was typical for a chair of this type. For two years, it was mostly comfortable and did the job of me not thinking about what was supporting my large body while I was doing my job.The last month or so, I was starting to feel more aches after sitting in it. This last week, it was wobbly and very unstable to sit in.

For the first few months it was fantastic - the cushion is comfortable, and the mesh back is great if you're the type that gets hot sitting in a leather or faux leather seat for chunks of time.I purchased the chair in July of 2022. It's March of 2023 and I'm already looking for a replacement after just 7ish months of use. I'm certainly below the rated weight limit, and despite that, I started encountering slow-but-consistent issues gradually popping up.The first thing to go was the screw that holds the left armrest in place (pictured). It somehow went straight through the foam-like material and ruined that armrest when I leaned against it. I got an annoying cut from it, but with some repositioning, I was able to get it into a decent enough position to be workable ...until the right armrest screw straight up fell out about a month later.After both armrests had their issues, the mechanism that stops you from leaning back all the way started acting up. As opposed to leaning straight back, it now leans back and to the side in a way that makes you feel like it will topple at any moment.Finally, and the straw that broke the camel's back this week, was the lift function stopping. You can lift the chair as high as it will go, and then very slowly sink back down to its lowest point while you're sitting. I'm glad to have an adjustable desk that I can lower to fit the chair's lowest point while I shop for a new one, but my desk is now at knee height, which isn't super fun.Considering the price, I shouldn't have had super high expectations - you get what you pay for. At the same time, it would have been nice to last at least a year? Instead I got a little over half a year of experiencing a new problem popping out of the blue to surprise me each month.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The assembly was typical for a chair of this type. For two years, it was mostly comfortable and did the job of me not thinking about what was supporting my large body while I was doing my job.The last month or so, I was starting to feel more aches after sitting in it. This last week, it was wobbly and very unstable to sit in. As I was switching the chair out with its replacement, my cat jumped on it and that was the final stress that broke the chair that I had for 2.5 years.

The comfort of it initially was actually quite good, but a month later the cushion was flat and I had to find myself an additional seat cushion.Otherwise, this chair has been fairly solid, though it seems the padding of the arms isn't properly screwed on as the screw fell out of it and I had to put it back in and it wouldn't really tighten down. It was as if the screw was screwed into the soft underside of the rubber arm padding itself rather than a pilot hole that is properly anchored into the padding.Over all, this chair was a very average to below average experience, which is upsetting as I was hoping to find something comfortable but I suppose you pay for what you get. This chair will do in a pinch but you very much need an additional seat cushion and hope that the parts you do receive are complete and undamaged.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 28 October 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Instructions are good and easy to follow, just look closely at the pictures (very few words, but diagrams are clear). Comes with an assembly tool and a few extra screws in case you misplace any (though just one extra of each). Chair seems well-built relative to other things in this price range, though still manufactured in China. Some adjustment on the width of the arms when assembling (or after if you flip it over and adjust the screws, ~1in. of travel in either direction). Seated position is a little forward with rock back tension that can be adjusted, but no lock back (only lock horizontal). Would say this is designed more as a productivity chair than say a gaming chair - can't lock back in reclined position, but this is more what I wanted anyway. Typical gas piston height adjustment. Seat cushion is both thick and comfortable. Back is high and well suited to taller people (why I bought this chair).Edit: Seemed good at first but broke within six months. Can't even figure out what's causing it to lean to one side now, all screws retightened but it still has an odd leftwards list to it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 March 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I weigh 280.  I have worked from home ever since I bought the chair so I spend 8-10 hours per weekday sitting in this chair.  The cushion in the seat was comfortable for the first ~6 months.  After that, I had to have a pad on top of the seat in order to sit comfortably.  Unfortunately, the pad raised the seat height too much and, over time, I ended up with ergonomic issues in my neck.  I cannot recommend this chair as my experience with its durability has been poor.  Besides the seat, the rest of the chair is still in good functional shape but what good is a chair that you can't sit on?","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 July 2022","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Although the gold on the chair and my desk are two different finishes of gold, it has a bit of a chic-like look and feel to it.I know many of the reviews say this chair is very easy to assemble but it‚Äôs more like semi-easy-ish. While understanding the parts and having the knowledge of assembling the chair, it‚Äôs not as easy to assemble if you‚Äôre doing it by yourself. Many of the screw placement holes don‚Äôt fully align correctly so you have to use force to manually align your parts to each hole in order to successfully drill all of your screws in tightly. Assembly time is much slower when using a manual Allen wrench so I suggest using a powered one instead as it‚Äôs more efficient.It‚Äôs a comfortable chair and I personally like the straight back support it gives me. I have read reviews that the chair will decline in quality after heavy use but unless you are jumping on this thing, I don‚Äôt think the wear and tear will happen. I can‚Äôt say the same for the faux leather element because we just never know.Overall, it‚Äôs not a bad chair for the price. I would recommend it for yourself.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2212","chair","Flash Furniture Mid-Back Transparent Black Mesh Executive Swivel Office Chair with Melrose Gold Frame and Flip-Up Arms, BL-8801X-GG","Tom Matthews","Bought for working from home. I liked that it had flip-up arms and seemed to have good amount of adjustments.Immediately after trying the chair I found its lumbar support was much too extreme, and could not be adjusted.  Above the lumbar support the back of the chair slopes off too sharply for your back to really rest on, so when sitting at the computer the only part of your back that touched the chair was your very lower back.  This quickly became too uncomfortable to use for a long period.  Also first impressions some of the materials felt cheap, and some of the paint was scratched and flaked off the chair before even taking it out of the box.  Between these issues I ended up returning the chair.As a positive the mesh seems good, the seat itself feels OK and decently supportive.  The recline for the seat back was nice and you could lock in place.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 9 October 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It looks like the paint had worn off on right side of seat but all in all it looks fantastic. It was  very easy to put together as I had an injury on one hand and had no issues. I thought the back rest looked a bit pronounced but fit my back like a glove. I bought this for my work station at work as they had raised it up to35‚Äù to he top chair will extend higher than I have it , around 33‚Äù but at 260lb it sank about 2‚Äù so a very comfortable height  the foot ring I did not raise as it was a good height for me. The controls for height and tilt are with in reach and operates  smoothly ,only issue I have I wish the are rests would LD ratchet to different levels but no biggey. I also purchased the roller blade wheels for the chair this only made a great chair awesome I need to get a hook or something to pull myself back to the desk as it rolls so smooth and quite this is my best purchase of the year I would highly recommend this chair no regrets here.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 14 March 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Little did I know we'd soon be asked to spend the next two weeks working from home to ""flatten the curve"".  Thankfully the product shipped quickly, was packaged very well and was easy to set up, because a couple weeks later that antique drafting table and this chair would become my new office.To my surprise, I'm closing in on a year of flattening the curve, and this chair has held up very well for something I only expected would see occasional use.  I've had a bit of a leak in the pneumatic cylinder, but only at the upper end of the stroke.  As a result it tends to sink down about an inch from my upper level set point, but it stays firm from there and it's still within a comfortable seating height, so I normally don't notice it.As for comfort, the chair is ergonomically very comfortable with firm back support.  My only complaint would be the mesh seating can feel a little rough when you have to sit through long online meetings and decide it's shorts day at ""work"" that day.  Otherwise, I'm very surprise how well the mesh fabric has held up for something in this pricepoint.  It feels just as supportive as the first day in my new office, and other that some dust and food crumbs doesn't really show any wear.I may occasionally (every 3 or 4) months tighten the foot ring, but I use it all the time and regularly push off on it to reposition myself.  Overall, it's been very sturdy.As we close in on the anniversary of ""two weeks to flatten the curve"", it looks like I'll be continuing daily use of this chair for some time to come.  I expect it to last quite a while yet, but if it failed tomorrow I wouldn't hesitate to order another one.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 February 2021","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Now that I‚Äôm used to it and it‚Äôs a bit more broken in I find that the seat bottom is comfortable for extended sitting and the arm rests are firm but comfortable enough. Speaking about the arm rests, I love that they fold up. I occasionally pick up a guitar to pluck a bit and it‚Äôs great for that use.Assembly was quick and painless, but unfortunately after putting the chair together I noticed that there was a cut in the seat back mesh. I contacted the seller and they worked with me to send a new seat back without any hassle, great customer service!Overall, I‚Äôm happy with the chair and would order it again. If I could give it 4-1/2 stars I would.Also worth noting, I‚Äôm a smaller guy at 5‚Äô10‚Äù 140lbs.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 June 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Yr old birthday present. He has never been happier. He loves the. footstool, but, I do not think that part is very comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and to me, it just feels awkward the way it fits my legs but,  that‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt use it when sitting in this chair.  It is better than no stool, I just think it could be made to fit and be formed to legs lengths better. I want one to support my feet to.  BUT, it‚Äôs a GREAT chair. 7 months later and many, many active, crazy, and excited 12 yr old boys not only gaming in it but  a few occasions of it being used to sleep in for the night, and it still works, sits and looks brand new!  I was a little leary on the quality and how long it would hold up for due to the price when comparing to similar chairs and most where $150 & up. But it‚Äôs been great. And if it was going to fall apart or tear up because of it being cheap quality (which. It obviously is not) believe me, my son, whom we refer to as  ‚ÄúThe Destroying Monkey‚Äù (why we call him this-he doesn‚Äôt walk, it‚Äôs always jumping to smack ceilings and doorways, darts in and out, flips or flops on everything, yanks and tosses, the 1 to test ALL buttons, knobs, dials and all that moves, AND assembles and unassembles everything to see what‚Äôs inside, including the Thermostat on the wall @ 2.  He can tear up even proven indestructible things, if you get the picture). He would have made it fall into pieces by now. He truly puts anything he sees, plays with, or sits on To the test of its quality and it‚Äôs limitations by throwing, tossing, using it for everything it was not intended for, flopping or laying sideways and upside down in or on it, and just being an overly curious, creative, imaginative wiggle worm and 12 yr old country boy.

"2268","chair","Office Chair PC Gaming Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Executive PU Leather Computer Chair Lumbar Support with Footrest Modern Task Rolling Swivel Racing Chair for Women&Men, Black","Izaiah fields","This is one of the more expensive ""gaming chairs"", not the most expensive, but you can find some for about half the price. If you get it on sale, I would recommend it. Overall it is a very comfortable chair to sit in for a few hours of gaming. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there are some areas with room for improvement: I like the footrest idea, but unless you are shorter than 5'6"", it really is not a great design. I am 6' tall, and the footrest ends up at about mid-calf range, which is not the most comfortable, I still end up needing something to rest my feet on. The armrests could be a little wider, with a little more cushion, maybe a little more ergonomically designed for the gamer, especially if you're gaming with a controller. I do however like the idea of the hinge aspect of the armrests, so they move back with you when you recline. Another thing I noticed (mostly due to my height again), is the neck/head pillow height. I find when I am sitting in the chair, that pillow actually ends up at my shoulders, and I can adjust it to where I need it, but as soon as I move it falls back to it's normal resting place, and I have to readjust every time I sit back down, so a nice improvement would be to see multiple slots for mounting that to accommodate a wider range of gamers more comfortably. The vibrating lumbar support cushion is a nice touch, it can help a little bit if you're getting some tension in your lower back, but it produces quite a loud buzzing sound, so often I don't use it, because it's just too distracting. The seat cushion is my favorite part of the chair, it's actually very nice and easy to sit on for long periods. The seat always tends to be the problem part of a chair for me, it's hard to find one comfortable for me to spend any time in without soreness. The long flat cushion spreads out your weight nicely, so there are no pressure points like your tailbone or in your thighs that end up hurting due to excessive pressure on that area. So, all in all, it's a decent mid range gaming chair, room for improvement definitely, particularly if you're an above average height gamer, but mostly a good solid chair, that is worth the money if you can get it for less than full price.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 December 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Customer service: was a joke, i sent them these pictures and they said ""we dont see anything wrong"" followed by ""if you are unsatisfied with the chair you can send it back"" so as mentioned before i have a back injury, bad enough to consider me legally disabled(i have a cane too to try and take the pressure off my back). so packing this thing up, taking it to my car and then to the post office is quite a struggle... i was just maybe hoping to get a replacement part or something.so all-in-all, spend the extra $20 and get a better chair. i would not recommend this product.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 23 May 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"

You better off just buying a stool.The arm rests are plastic and kind of lose but the screws are tight (Wonder how that happened).The chair if you move the back down make sure to move up with it or the chair will sucker punch you (Believe me I speak from experience and multiple times of the chair literally moving the back, back up and just straight hitting my jaw full force.).I already have a job that induces back pain. Why not buy a chair that adds to it! This chair doesn't have the best back support and make me feels like the chair cares more about itself then you.If I thought better when I sat on it for the first time i should have just returned it because if it is not comfortable for you and you tell yourself ""Itll form to me"" good luck because that sure aint never gonna happen.This chair I've tightened the screws many times but the ones for the wheels keep coming lose and for some reason i can rock the chair on the stem. That shouldn't be a problem but it is and make me think if one day im gonna lay back and just fall over.Easy to assemble, hard to enjoy,The only thing nice about this chair is the pillow vibrator but even then i dont use it because it sounds like a jet engine.Moral of the story.Don't waste your money, gaming chairs cheap or expensive isn't worth it. Buy a actually office chair because I bet you itll be more comfortable and better on your back then this piece of junk.And word to the company that makes this chair:""Please never make a chair again"" thank you.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 15 November 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"

My feet do not touch the ground so its not short (my feet hang about an inch above the ground), but the structure feels somewhat small compared to another gamer chair I had before. Sitting fully upright and butt all the way back, I still have an inch of space before the seat touches the back of my calves, so the seat isn't that big too. Now what I do feel too wide is the arm rests, it would be nice if I could move them in more, and if I could adjust them down or up. It's tad bit too wide. When the footrest is inside the chair, it's upside down and the plastic is a little sharp, so may cut the back of your calves. The lower back-pad with vibrator is nice if using it for vibrator, but its a bit thick if not using it for vibrator, it may get annoying later. Also, the arm rests, underneath them is pretty sharp too.So basically, back-piece is a little short, seat is a little short, armrests are little wide and not adjustable, back-pad is a bit thick, and underneath the arm rests and foot rest is a bit sharp.Its not too bad, but not too good either. It was easy to install, and the wheels are tough to get in, they bit different than other wheels I seen. It is somewhat comfy seat, the back-pad with vibrator is a bit too thick though.This chair is one of the cheaper ones, but still expensive, around $100, so kind of disappointed and kind of expected. It's cheaper against the other chairs of its kind, but its not really cheap when you just think about the price.I'll probably spend $50 more and get a better chair next time. This chair is cheap compared to others like it, but its still expensive. This chair lacks customization of the features, and could work on smoothing out sharp areas of the chair that I think would make it better and probably 4/5 stars.Also, I think I'd go with one without vibrator next time too, its nice but its very sturdy and thick, I miss regular cushion. I normally sit with legs somewhat spread apart, and its a bit uncomfortable with these side pieces towards the end of the seat. They a bit too tall and sturdy. It's not a bad chair, but could be a lot better. So I give this chair a 3/5.I changed my mind to 1/5, its just not comfortable anymore, the sides on the seat irritate my thighs. I wanted to see the padding, which is good but I noticed they removed all the zipper hangings probably because so many people checking and finding things wrong, so they removed all of them to make it difficult to check. The arm rest is sharp as well as the foot rest when its docked underneath the chair, the back of my calves brush against it. The massage pad I would go without one, its just too stiff and I hardly use it. It pushes you too far in the seat because too thick and I don't get to enjoy the headrest due to how thick the massage pad is. Sitting indian style in the chair is uncomfortable too, its just not wide enough and/or the side piece is too tall and sturdy, needs to be bent outwards more and not so pointy.Pictures are showing the sharp plastic underneath the arm rest and an arm can fit in between which is bad due to sharp plastic, the sharp plastic on the footrest, and zipper without zipper grips (they must have ripped them off, due to people inspecting the padding).I just got the chair 13 July, 2020, and already want to return it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

You better off just buying a stool.The arm rests are plastic and kind of lose but the screws are tight (Wonder how that happened).The chair if you move the back down make sure to move up with it or the chair will sucker punch you (Believe me I speak from experience and multiple times of the chair literally moving the back, back up and just straight hitting my jaw full force.).I already have a job that induces back pain. Why not buy a chair that adds to it! This chair doesn't have the best back support and make me feels like the chair cares more about itself then you.If I thought better when I sat on it for the first time i should have just returned it because if it is not comfortable for you and you tell yourself ""Itll form to me"" good luck because that sure aint never gonna happen.This chair I've tightened the screws many times but the ones for the wheels keep coming lose and for some reason i can rock the chair on the stem. That shouldn't be a problem but it is and make me think if one day im gonna lay back and just fall over.Easy to assemble, hard to enjoy,The only thing nice about this chair is the pillow vibrator but even then i dont use it because it sounds like a jet engine.Moral of the story.Don't waste your money, gaming chairs cheap or expensive isn't worth it. Buy a actually office chair because I bet you itll be more comfortable and better on your back then this piece of junk.And word to the company that makes this chair:""Please never make a chair again"" thank you.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 15 November 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"

My feet do not touch the ground so its not short (my feet hang about an inch above the ground), but the structure feels somewhat small compared to another gamer chair I had before. Sitting fully upright and butt all the way back, I still have an inch of space before the seat touches the back of my calves, so the seat isn't that big too. Now what I do feel too wide is the arm rests, it would be nice if I could move them in more, and if I could adjust them down or up. It's tad bit too wide. When the footrest is inside the chair, it's upside down and the plastic is a little sharp, so may cut the back of your calves. The lower back-pad with vibrator is nice if using it for vibrator, but its a bit thick if not using it for vibrator, it may get annoying later. Also, the arm rests, underneath them is pretty sharp too.So basically, back-piece is a little short, seat is a little short, armrests are little wide and not adjustable, back-pad is a bit thick, and underneath the arm rests and foot rest is a bit sharp.Its not too bad, but not too good either. It was easy to install, and the wheels are tough to get in, they bit different than other wheels I seen. It is somewhat comfy seat, the back-pad with vibrator is a bit too thick though.This chair is one of the cheaper ones, but still expensive, around $100, so kind of disappointed and kind of expected. It's cheaper against the other chairs of its kind, but its not really cheap when you just think about the price.I'll probably spend $50 more and get a better chair next time. This chair is cheap compared to others like it, but its still expensive. This chair lacks customization of the features, and could work on smoothing out sharp areas of the chair that I think would make it better and probably 4/5 stars.Also, I think I'd go with one without vibrator next time too, its nice but its very sturdy and thick, I miss regular cushion. I normally sit with legs somewhat spread apart, and its a bit uncomfortable with these side pieces towards the end of the seat. They a bit too tall and sturdy. It's not a bad chair, but could be a lot better. So I give this chair a 3/5.I changed my mind to 1/5, its just not comfortable anymore, the sides on the seat irritate my thighs. I wanted to see the padding, which is good but I noticed they removed all the zipper hangings probably because so many people checking and finding things wrong, so they removed all of them to make it difficult to check. The arm rest is sharp as well as the foot rest when its docked underneath the chair, the back of my calves brush against it. The massage pad I would go without one, its just too stiff and I hardly use it. It pushes you too far in the seat because too thick and I don't get to enjoy the headrest due to how thick the massage pad is. Sitting indian style in the chair is uncomfortable too, its just not wide enough and/or the side piece is too tall and sturdy, needs to be bent outwards more and not so pointy.Pictures are showing the sharp plastic underneath the arm rest and an arm can fit in between which is bad due to sharp plastic, the sharp plastic on the footrest, and zipper without zipper grips (they must have ripped them off, due to people inspecting the padding).I just got the chair 13 July, 2020, and already want to return it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Very sturdy so far, and I love the adjustable pillows for your back and neck/head. The first thing I noticed is that the separate components of the chair, while packaged individually, were dirty. I tried to clean the chair pieces as best as I could, and the photos that I am sharing show what remains of the dark spots. I am a bit disappointed by this. Additionally, the instructions were small pictures, with only a few words that did not explain much about how to assemble the chair. Obviously, I figured it out, but if you struggle with directions and require written instructions, ask a friend to help you.

When I received the chair, it came with no instructions, although wasn‚Äôt difficult to put together.However, the bad part was when I tried to connect the back of the chair to the bottom. The screws I got did not come with nuts or anything to keep the back of the chair in place. So when I tried to attach it, the back of the chair would fall off. I went to Home Depot and bought some nuts, now there‚Äôs no issue. Maybe it was just a manufacturing error and the back of the chair isn‚Äôt supposed to have nuts to keep it attached to the bottom, but regardless I still had to go buy a pack of nuts for 2.75.While this chair fits me comfortably, I am a small guy in terms of height, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and 175 lbs. If you happen to be significantly taller or bigger than me, definitely go for another chair, you will probably not fit in this one.Now that the chair is assembled, it‚Äôs quite comfortable, although I wish the bottom part of the chair had a bit more cushion. I have a fat behind and even I think the bottom of this chair lacks cushioning. The chair is fairly comfortable otherwise and pretty stylish looking. I especially like the foot rest, it‚Äôs something I didn‚Äôt realize how much I needed until now.Had this chair not been missing any pieces, I would rate this a 4/5, but because it was missing pieces, I‚Äôm giving it a 3/5.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 31 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I've checked everything is tight, but after careful listening and feeling around, have discovered that the creak is coming from the actual metal framework inside the backrest section.It‚Äôs a real shame, because it does take the edge off a brilliant chair otherwise.UPDATE: After informing Autofull of the creak, they immediately replaced the chair with a new one. It arrived within a couple of days and so far all is good. Really impressed with the service and there was no hesitation in resolving the problem.

"2327","chair","AutoFull Gaming Chair Ergonomic Gamer Chair with 3D Bionic Lumbar Support Racing Style PU Leather Computer Gaming Chair for Adults with Footrest,Brown","Beau","To be clear, my order arrived yesterday and I haven't had chance to daily drive it for an extended period, so this will mostly focus on first impressions and build process.The chair arrived in a massive box which was awkward in size and weight so if you have mobility challenges, you may want to have help from the courier or a neighbour.Instructions were printed on cheap paper and had a number of low Res images which made it less clear in one instance of which bolts to use, so I ended up guessing and it seems right so far.Luckily, the rest of the bolts are already in most parts (not tightened) so you only have to unscrew them, position the relevant part, and reinsert the bolts. Super easy.Altogether the chair took around 30mins to build by myself, with only one area presenting a challenge. That was the back when attaching it to the base, a second person would have been nice.

WHERE DO I SIGN UP FOR THAT JOB!I needed something to place an alarm clock, some pill bottles, my phone, and a  large glass of water on top of this table overnight. This table proves to be too unstable, and the glass of water spilled over after seemingly small movements and barely touching the stand on the first night of use. I tried to use a water bottle instead of a glass, but it fell of a couple of times when I brushed my hand against the table while replacing the bottle back onto the stand, after taking a drink in the wee hours o' the morning.I tried putting it further away from the bed so my sheets or blanket would not hit the table when I flip over, (I toss and turn a lot at night) but had to reach farther away and be cautions not let my hand brush against the stand or the water would spill and the pill bottles and would fall over and roll off.I can see this for someone who wants to use is for an alarm clock, phone charging/stand, a small lamp, a book or two and maybe a few other things. Or use it for a small end table for keeping remotes, phone, a small lamp. But not good for keeping or putting on top of it anything that might fall over when unbalanced.Construction for the price point is decent, and it looks nice. You can  tell the MDF/particle board whichever, or as their calling these now 'engineered woods' (sawdust and resin, and pretty soon they won't even be using the sawdust at all) is sturdier than most other low end furnishings in this price range.I can't recommend it for what I needed it for, but it might work for you, but it is wobbly and any liquid in a  drinking glass, or a soup bowl will likely spill over onto the table top and floor.I will give it an overall 4 stars because I was already aware of the table's potential to wobble after reading comments and Q&A sections, and it was a little better than I expected but not as good as I needed it to be, so I took a chance.  And I really didn't expect that I'd be getting a hand crafted 'MADE PRIMARILY FROM ACTUAL TREE WOOD' nightstand.I'd like to keep it if I had a use for it, I've already printed the Amazon return label.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 April 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2415","chair","Furinno Coffee Table with Bins, Espresso/Brown","Jochebed Garcia","i had already ordered some night stands of this brand already and was pleased with the product I was expecting the same with this coffee table. It is small and super easy to put together. I am in a studio apartment and it is the perfect size although it is a little shorter than I had hoped, none the less it makes my living room work. The drawers a small but big enough I can fit the typical TV remotes and video game controllers.  The fabric drawers leave a little more to be desired just kind of want them to be a little more rigid like a drawer but I can always find others. I have seen other people ask questions about how sturdy this is and that is the only ""flaw"" and I don't even want to call it a flaw it's just the only thing I REALLY think it needs work on. You can eat off it no problem, writing on it no problem, you can lean or even prop your feet on it. However no you cannot put your aquarium on it, no you cannot stand on it and you should probably not put a TV on here. This is a coffee table it is small. It is also make of particle board. It's a bit wobbly and won't hold much weight but for eating, propping up feet or even doing some work on the floor it is great. The price is awesome and you can get a whole set from the same brand cheap. Would totally recommend this coffee table and their night stands for the minimalist type of person and someone looking for something cheap that gets the job done.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 22 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2427","table","Furinno Coffee Table with Bins, Espresso/Brown","Shumba, Halifax","I bought this despite many bad reviews; there were also good ones -- I might be lucky!I don't understand reviewers who complained it was small.  Didn't they look at the very clear measurements before they ordered it? It's exactly as advertised  (& exactly what I wanted).And I don't understand reviewers who complained it wasn't the greatest quality.  Did they expect the quality of tables two or three times the price?  Time will tell whether it stands up to my expectations of a lower-cost product -- initially, it does.Mine arrived late, with an apology from Amazon.  All parts were there, & nothing was damaged.  The surfaces have marks that aren't part of the grain, but they blend in & are acceptable.  I intend to get a piece of glass cut to cover the top; reviews suggest that it marks very easily.Assembly was quick & easy.  I was gentle, since some reviews reported damage during assembly.  I think some of the pictures in the instructions could be improved, but with common sense I had no problems.  However, a big negative was the holes that were drilled for the dowels.  I pushed the dowels in with my thumb, not the rubber hammer suggested, & they went in so far that very little remained above the surface (until I pulled them back out half-way with pliers). It would be better if the dowel holes were drilled to a depth of half the dowels' length -- presumably it affects the overall sturdiness of the product if two parts don't make an equal connection.It's fine with or without the drawers.  I'm going to lift rather than drag it if I move it, despite the little feet you hammer in the bottom; I can anticipate the sides of the 'legs' lifting off if they catch on carpet or other floor-covering.I bought this purely on size -- I couldn't find anything else the same.

They work perfectly as I envisioned, and look fantastic. Also a great way to store and display my records as they fit beautifully on the bottom shelf.Some parts were difficult to assemble as the production isn‚Äôt very precise, but the twist assembly is fantastic.

"2473","chair","Furinno Wooden Side Table with 3 Shelves Sonoma Oak/White 29.21 x 34.04 x 57.91 cm","Rain Bow","After buying and giving away numerous small chests of drawers to sit either side of the bed, I decided a table would be better.  I tested this with a small table at home and it seemed to work so I began to look for something more appropriate.I landed on this sales page during my search through the options on Amazon.  I liked the height - perfect for the side of a bed.  I liked the size - not too large so would not get in the way (it isn't a huge bedroom).  I liked the idea of a couple of shelves since it would mean I could ""share"" on different shelves what normally sits cluttered on the top.I decided to take the risk and order 2 of these tables in the black and white, with white tube legs.  I felt having contrasting colours set against white bedding and a white headboard would fit nicely.  I was right, the two-colour scheme is ideal.Delivery was naturally quick with Amazon and each table was housed in its own box.  A quick slice around to remove the sellotape, everything seemed to be packaged neatly so I removed each item.  I decided to first try with the black tops on the top and bottom, with the white shelf top in the centre (turns out that was a good choice in my case).Construction - if only all flat-packed furniture was as easy as this to construct. One glance at the instructions to find the order of putting things together and I didn't need them again.  A quick dust of the shelves and the first one was ready to sit next to the bed.  Perfect.For the second box I decided to time myself.  Obviously the construction was identical to the first.  From the time I started to open the box to the time I wiped surface dust away was... a mere 8 minutes.  Like I said, if only all flat-packed furniture was this easy.  The second table went on the other side of the bed, job done, boxes into recycling bin.Although plastic tubes for the legs, they are quite thick and the whole unit is very sturdy.  Each piece screws into the one beneath it so it effectively holds itself together.  I should imagine it would be just as easy to unscrew parts if ever I wanted to change the top colour of any of the shelves.Negatives - I didn't expect absolute perfection, not for the price these were.  However, I did feel that the finish of the white binding could have been much better, especially where it meets white against white.  As I said, for the price I didn't expect perfection but given that the binding is an integral part of the design, it could have been applied better.  Thankfully, given where the tables are, I doubt if anyone would ever get close enough to inspect.  There was a 6"" ""smudge across the middle of one of the shelves, on the black side.  This was clearly done at the factory and no amount of rubbing would shift it.  Fortunately, I could use this as a centre shelf with a white top, but it would cause problems if ever I wanted to have all shelf tops in black.As a result of the unnecessary ""smudge"" that should have been picked up by quality control, and the not-so-good finish with the binding around the shelves, I have removed one star from my review, simply because I felt it best to give future customers an idea of what to look for.Priced at ¬£18.29 at the time of this review for each table, even with the slight flaws I have mentioned, I find the price to be acceptable.  They were easy to construct, plenty sturdy enough for bedside tables, will easily hold whatever I need to put on them, and I do like the black and white colouring, it is quite striking.  Even with the flaws, I will recommend this product, I doubt if you would get much better for the money and I am satisfied enough.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Fortunately, I could use this as a centre shelf with a white top, but it would cause problems if ever I wanted to have all shelf tops in black.As a result of the unnecessary ""smudge"" that should have been picked up by quality control, and the not-so-good finish with the binding around the shelves, I have removed one star from my review, simply because I felt it best to give future customers an idea of what to look for.Priced at ¬£18.29 at the time of this review for each table, even with the slight flaws I have mentioned, I find the price to be acceptable.  They were easy to construct, plenty sturdy enough for bedside tables, will easily hold whatever I need to put on them, and I do like the black and white colouring, it is quite striking.  Even with the flaws, I will recommend this product, I doubt if you would get much better for the money and I am satisfied enough.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
