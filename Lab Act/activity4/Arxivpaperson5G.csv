In this paper, we propose an Over-the-Air federated learning algorithm that aims to provide fairness and robustness through minmax optimization. By using the epigraph form of the problem at hand, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution of the minmax problem. Moreover, the proposed approach does not require reconstructing channel coefficients by complex encoding-decoding schemes as opposed to state-of-the-art approaches. This improves both efficiency and privacy.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 12:03:04 UTC (520 KB)"
"2","Performance evaluation of conditional handover in 5G systems under fading scenario","Souvik Deb, Megh Rathod, Rishi Balamurugan, Shankar K. Ghosh, Rajeev K. Singh, Samriddha Sanyal","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","To enhance the handover performance in fifth generation (5G) cellular systems, conditional handover (CHO) has been evolved as a promising solution. Unlike A3 based handover where handover execution is certain after receiving handover command from the serving access network, in CHO, handover execution is conditional on the RSRP measurements from both current and target access networks, as well as on mobility parameters such as preparation and execution offsets. Analytic evaluation of conditional handover performance is unprecedented in literature. In this work, handover performance of CHO has been carried out in terms of handover latency, handover packet loss and handover failure probability. A Markov model accounting the effect of different mobility parameters (e.g., execution offset, preparation offset, time-to-preparation and time-to-execution), UE velocity and channel fading characteristics; has been proposed to characterize handover failure. Results obtained from the analytic model has been validated against extensive simulation results. Our study reveal that optimal configuration of $O_{exec}$, $O_{prep}$, $T_{exec}$ and $T_{prep}$ is actually conditional on underlying UE velocity and fading characteristics. This study will be helpful for the mobile operators to choose appropriate thresholds of the mobility parameters under different channel condition and UE velocities.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 10:11:07 UTC (837 KB)"
"3","ZF Beamforming Tensor Compression for Massive MIMO Fronthaul","Libin Zheng, Zihao Wang, Minru Bai, Zhenjie Tan","Information Theory (cs.IT)","In the rapidly evolving landscape of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) mobile cellular communications, efficient data compression and reconstruction strategies become paramount, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A critical challenge in these systems is the capacity-limited fronthaul, particularly in the context of the Ethernet-based common public radio interface (eCPRI) connecting baseband units (BBUs) and remote radio units (RRUs). This capacity limitation hinders the effective handling of increased traffic and data flows. We propose a novel two-stage compression approach to address this bottleneck. The first stage employs sparse Tucker decomposition, targeting the weight tensor's low-rank components for compression. The second stage further compresses these components using complex givens decomposition and run-length encoding, substantially improving the compression ratio. Our approach specifically targets the Zero-Forcing (ZF) beamforming weights in BBUs. By reconstructing these weights in RRUs, we significantly alleviate the burden on eCPRI traffic, enabling a higher number of concurrent streams in the radio access network (RAN). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method in Channel State Information (CSI) compression, paving the way for more efficient 5G/B5G fronthaul links.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 12:57:37 UTC (1,074 KB)"
"4","Scalable Network Tomography for Dynamic Spectrum Access","Aadesh Madnaik, N. Cameron Matson, Karthikeyan Sundaresan","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","Mobile networks have increased spectral efficiency through advanced multiplexing strategies that are coordinated by base stations (BS) in licensed spectrum. However, external interference on clients leads to significant performance degradation during dynamic (unlicensed) spectrum access (DSA). We introduce the notion of network tomography for DSA, whereby clients are transformed into spectrum sensors, whose joint access statistics are measured and used to account for interfering sources. Albeit promising, performing such tomography naively incurs an impractical overhead that scales exponentially with the multiplexing order of the strategies deployed -- which will only continue to grow with 5G/6G technologies. To this end, we propose a novel, scalable network tomography framework called NeTo-X that estimates joint client access statistics with just linear overhead, and forms a blue-print of the interference, thus enabling efficient DSA for future networks. NeTo-X's design incorporates intelligent algorithms that leverage multi-channel diversity and the spatial locality of interference impact on clients to accurately estimate the desired interference statistics from just pair-wise measurements of its clients. The merits of its framework are showcased in the context of resource management and jammer localization applications, where its performance significantly outperforms baseline approaches and closely approximates optimal performance at a scalable overhead.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 00:03:00 UTC (7,249 KB)"
"5","Neural Codebook Design for Network Beam Management","Ryan M. Dreifuerst, Robert W. Heath Jr","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Obtaining accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge for large antenna systems. Mobile systems like 5G use a beam management framework that joins the initial access, beamforming, CSI acquisition, and data transmission. The design of codebooks for these stages, however, is challenging due to their interrelationships, varying array sizes, and site-specific channel and user distributions. Furthermore, beam management is often focused on single-sector operations while ignoring the overarching network- and system-level optimization. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end learned codebook design algorithm, network beamspace learning (NBL), that captures and optimizes codebooks to mitigate interference while maximizing the achievable performance with extremely large hybrid arrays. The proposed algorithm requires limited shared information yet designs codebooks that outperform traditional codebooks by over 10dB in beam alignment and achieve more than 25% improvements in network spectral efficiency.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 15:37:06 UTC (2,095 KB)"

Different from the existing contributions that considered single-carrier mmWave systems with high mobility, the wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is considered in this work. To solve the channel estimation problem under channel double selectivity, we propose a pilot transmission scheme based on 5G OFDM, and the received signals are formed as a fourth-order tensor, which fits the low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model. By further exploring the Vandermonde structure of factor matrix, a tensor-subspace decomposition based channel estimation method is proposed to solve the CP decomposition, where the uniqueness condition is analyzed. Based on the decomposed factor matrices, the channel parameters, including angles of arrival/departure, delays, channel gains and Doppler shifts are estimated, and the Cram√©r-Rao bound (CRB) results are derived as performance metrics. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over other benchmarks. Furthermore, the channel estimation methods are tested based on the channel parameters generated by Wireless InSites, and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical scenarios.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 13:13:01 UTC (2,258 KB)"
"7","Over-The-Air Double-Threshold Deep Learner for Jamming Detection in 5G RF domain","Ghazal Asemian, Mohammadreza Amini, Burak Kantarci, Melike Erol-Kantarci","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","With the evolution of 5G wireless communications, the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) plays a critical role in the synchronization of devices and accessibility of services. However, due to the predictable nature of SSB transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), jamming attacks are critical threats. By leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in 5G networks. Unlike the existing jamming detection algorithms that mostly rely on network parameters, we introduce a double threshold deep learning jamming detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a preprocessing block that extracts PSS correlation and energy per null resource elements (EPNRE) characteristics, our method distinguishes between normal and jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporation of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are optimized. A double threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal to jamming noise ratio (SJNR). Results show that the proposed method achieves 96.4% detection rate in extra low jamming power, i.e., SJNR between 15 to 30 dB which outperforms the single threshold DNN design with 86.0% detection rate and unprocessed IQ sample DNN design with 83.2% detection rate. Ultimately, performance of DT-DDNN is validated through the analysis of real 5G signals obtained from a practical testbed, demonstrating a strong alignment with the simulation results.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 04:29:31 UTC (5,725 KB)"

This transition to ubiquitous intelligence demands high connectivity, synchronicity, and end-to-end communication between users and network operators, and will pave the way towards full network automation without human intervention. Intent-based networking is a key factor in the reduction of human actions, roles, and responsibilities while shifting towards novel extraction and interpretation of automated network management.

Cooperative networks, in particular, are expected to enhance sensing services by enlarging the coverage area and enriching sensing measurements, thus improving the service availability and accuracy. This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework by leveraging information-carrying orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals transmitted by access points (APs). Specifically, we propose a two-stage scheme for target localization, where communication signals are reused as sensing reference signals based on the system information shared at the central processing unit (CPU). In Stage I, we measure the ranges of scattered paths induced by targets, through the extraction of time-delay information from the received signals at APs. Then, the target locations are estimated in Stage II based on these range measurements. Considering that the scattered paths corresponding to some targets may not be detectable by all APs, we propose an effective algorithm to match the range measurements with the targets and achieve the target location estimation. Notably, by analyzing the OFDM numerologies defined in fifth generation (5G) standards, we elucidate the flexibility and consistency of performance trade-offs in both communication and sensing aspects. Finally, numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our sensing scheme and the cooperative gain of the ISAC framework.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 13:34:04 UTC (784 KB)"

Virtualization extends up to the 5G core, where software-defined networks and network slicing implement a customizable environment. These technologies can be controlled via application programming interfaces and web technologies, inheriting hence their security risks and settings. An attacker exploiting vulnerable implementations of the 5G core may gain privileged control of the network assets and disrupt its availability. However, there is currently no security assessment of the web security of the 5G core network. In this paper, we present the first security assessment of the 5G core from a web security perspective. We use the STRIDE threat modeling approach to define a complete list of possible threat vectors and associated attacks. Thanks to a suite of security testing tools, we cover all of these threats and test the security of the 5G core. In particular, we test the three most relevant open-source 5G core implementations, i.e., Open5GS, Free5Gc, and OpenAirInterface. Our analysis shows that all these cores are vulnerable to at least two of our identified attack vectors, demanding increased security measures in the development of future 5G core networks.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 09:27:11 UTC (774 KB)"

Our work aims to address the absence of studies that reveal the real-world behavior of low-latency video streaming. To that end, we provide an experimental methodology and measurements, collected in a US metropolitan area over a commercial 5G network, that correlates application-level QoE and lower-layer metrics on the devices, such as RSRP, RSRQ, handover records, etc., under both static and mobility scenarios. We find that RAN-side information, which is readily available on every cellular device, has the potential to enhance throughput estimation modules of video streaming clients, ultimately making low-latency streaming more resilient against network perturbations and handover events.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 18:52:21 UTC (4,338 KB)"

These two bands promise to unlock a large portion of untapped spectrum, but the harsh propagation due to the increased carrier frequency might negatively impact the performance of urban Radio Access Network (RAN) deployments. Within the span of a year, two co-located 5G networks operating in these frequency bands were deployed at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, entirely dedicated to the dense urban performance assessment of the two systems. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the measurement campaigns conducted on them, with the U6G campaign representing the first of its kind. A benchmark is provided by ray-tracing simulations. The results suggest that networks operating in these frequency bands provide good indoor and outdoor coverage and throughput in urban scenarios, even when deployed in the macro base station setup common to lower frequencies. In addition, a comparative performance analysis of these two key technologies is provided, offering insights on their relative strengths, weaknesses and improvement margins and informing on which bands is better suited for urban macro coverage.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 16:59:34 UTC (11,737 KB)"
"13","Diffraction and Scattering Aware Radio Map and Environment Reconstruction using Geometry Model-Assisted Deep Learning","Wangqian Chen, Junting Chen","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Machine learning (ML) facilitates rapid channel modeling for 5G and beyond wireless communication systems. Many existing ML techniques utilize a city map to construct the radio map; however, an updated city map may not always be available. This paper proposes to employ the received signal strength (RSS) data to jointly construct the radio map and the virtual environment by exploiting the geometry structure of the environment. In contrast to many existing ML approaches that lack of an environment model, we develop a virtual obstacle model and characterize the geometry relation between the propagation paths and the virtual obstacles. A multi-screen knife-edge model is adopted to extract the key diffraction features, and these features are fed into a neural network (NN) for diffraction representation. To describe the scattering, as oppose to most existing methods that directly input an entire city map, our model focuses on the geometry structure from the local area surrounding the TX-RX pair and the spatial invariance of such local geometry structure is exploited. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to reconstructing a 3D virtual environment, the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in radio map construction with 10%-18% accuracy improvements. It can also reduce 20% data and 50% training epochs when transferred to a new environment.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 02:20:01 UTC (33,141 KB)"

Its primary objective is to provide advanced analytics services to various entities within the network and also towards external application services in the 5G ecosystem. One of the key use cases of NWDAF is mobility trajectory prediction, which aims to accurately support efficient mobility management of User Equipment (UE) in the network by allocating ``just in time'' necessary network resources. In this paper, we show that there are potential mobility attacks that can compromise the accuracy of these predictions. In a semi-realistic scenario with 10,000 subscribers, we demonstrate that an adversary equipped with the ability to hijack cellular mobile devices and clone them can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy from 75\% to 40\% using just 100 adversarial UEs. While a defense mechanism largely depends on the attack and the mobility types in a particular area, we prove that a basic KMeans clustering is effective in distinguishing legitimate and adversarial UEs.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:24:19 UTC (475 KB)"

RTG is a stronger EESS protection mechanism than the current methodology recommended by the ITU based on a worst-case interference threshold while simultaneously enabling dynamic spectrum sharing and coexistence with 5G or 6G wireless networks. Similarly, verifying more sophisticated RF propagation models that include ground topology, buildings, and non-line-of-sight paths will provide better estimates of interference than the current ITU line-of-sight model and, thus, a more reliable basis for establishing a consensus among the spectrum stakeholders.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:35:32 UTC (788 KB)"

Since then, two new classes of network devices - 5G repeaters and high transmission power User Equipment (UE) for fixed wireless services - have been introduced and deployed in 28 GHz networks with expectations that they will also be deployed at 24 GHz. This paper discusses the (potentially significant) increase in interference from these new components along with open questions related to their regulatory status. While this paper discusses increases in interference to 23.8 GHz EESS measurements from 5G transmissions in the ""24 GHz"" band, it is important to recognize that repeaters and high power UEs need to be considered when modeling interference from 5G/6G networks in all bands. This paper also touches on whether the current ITU process and methodology to regulate interference with passive sensors (vendor applied hardware-based filtering based on long-term network forecasts and worst-case Monte Carlo modeling) can keep up with rapidly changing wireless technology and the increased competition for spectrum.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:18:14 UTC (519 KB)"

We study the performance of a self-burrowing probe under different gravity conditions, from low gravity (i.e., 1/6g, 1/3g and 1g) to high gravity (i.e., 5g, 10g and 15g), specifically in terms of penetration distance and energy consumption. Results show that the probe reaches efficient penetration in all gravity conditions and that it achieves larger penetration distances in high gravity conditions. However, the penetration efficiency, shown as unit energy per meter, is higher in low gravity. Additionally, we prove that a simple dimensional analysis provides reasonable scaling factors for first order effects in forces, velocities and energy. The findings in this study give confidence to the potential use of self-burrowing probes in campaigns of soil testing and sensor deployment in outer space or centrifuges in which the gravity conditions can differ from Earth.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 10:13:30 UTC (1,865 KB)"

In order to suppress co-scheduled users' interference, HBF MU-MIMO is predicated on having sufficient radio frequency chains and accurate channel state information (CSI), which can otherwise lead to performance losses due to imperfect interference cancellation. In this work, we propose IABA, a 5G-NR standard-compliant beam pair link (BPL) allocation scheme for mitigating spatial interference in practical HBF MU-MIMO networks. IABA solves the network sum throughput optimization via either a distributed or a centralized BPL allocation using dedicated CSI reference signals for candidate BPL monitoring. We present a comprehensive study of practical multi-cell mm-wave networks and demonstrate that HBF MU-MIMO without interference-aware BPL allocation experiences strong residual interference which limits the achievable network performance. Our results show that IABA offers significant performance gains over the default interference-agnostic 5G-NR BPL allocation, and even allows HBF MU-MIMO to outperform the fully digital MU-MIMO baseline, by facilitating allocation of secondary BPLs other than the strongest BPL found during initial access. We further demonstrate the scalability of IABA with increased gNB antennas and densification for beyond-5G mm-wave networks.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:09:20 UTC (1,705 KB)"

To address this challenge, recent works have introduced the concept of satellite cluster networks where multiple satellites in a cluster collaborate to enhance the network performance. In order to investigate the performance of these networks, we propose mathematical analyses by modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point processes, building on the success of stochastic geometry-based analyses for satellite networks. In particular, we suggest the lower and upper bounds of the coverage probability as functions of the system parameters, including satellite density, satellite altitude, satellite cluster area, path loss exponent, and Nakagami parameter $m$. We validate the analytical expressions by comparing them with simulation results.

In the infinite-length region, we prove that the random SGMC is capacity-achieving over binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) channels. In the finite-length region, we present the representative ordered statistics decoding with local constraints (LC-ROSD) algorithm for the SGMCs. The most distinguished feature of the SGMCs with LC-ROSD is that the staircase-like matrices enable parallel implementation of the Gaussian elimination (GE), avoiding the serial GE of conventional OSD and supporting a potential low decoding latency, as implied from simulations. To analyze the performance of random SGMCs in the finite-length region, we derive the ensemble weight spectrum and invoke the conventional union bound. We also derive a partially random coding union (RCU) bound, which is tighter than the conventional one and is used as a criterion to design the SGMCs. Staircase-like generator matrices allow us to derive a series of (tighter and tighter) lower bounds based on the second-order Bonferroni inequality with the incremental number of codewords. The numerical results show that the decoding performance can match well with the proposed partially RCU bound for different code rates and different profiles. The numerical results also show that the tailored SGMCs with the LC-ROSD algorithm can approach the finite-length performance bound, outperforming the 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, 5G polar codes, and Reed-Muller (RM) codes.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 02:09:19 UTC (2,965 KB)"

Guevara, Hazem Sallouha, Sofie Pollin","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) used as infrastructure in wireless networks has been a trend, thanks to its low cost and high flexibility. Working in many ways including reflective mirrors and phase-shifted surfaces, RIS is able to enhance the coverage in communications and provide more degrees of freedom for sensing. However, the key issue lies in how to place RIS in accordance with the regulations for electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure, which requires refined evaluations. In this paper, we first investigate the regulations in terms of E-field. Then, relevant deployment characteristics are evaluated jointly: the minimum distance from the base station (BS) to the RIS, and the minimum height of the RIS are given for a given BS power limit and as function of the number of RIS elements. The ray-tracing simulations verify the correctness of our analysis. Besides, different frequency ranges (FRs) and radiation patterns of RIS elements are investigated. The results show that the EMF exposure risk is negligible when RIS works in the reflective-only (RO) mode. However, when it works in the beamforming (BO) mode, its placement should be well specified based on our analytical framework to comply with the regulations of E-field limit in general public scenarios. Finally, we provide an E-field measurement methodology and low-cost solutions in terms of general wireless networks and 5G standalone networks, which pave the way for real-world evaluation in future work.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:46:06 UTC (1,299 KB)"

The rapid development of computer vision has enabled unmanned aerial vehicles to perform various high-altitude detection tasks. Because the field of object detection for antenna interference sources has not been fully explored, this industry lacks dedicated learning samples and detection models for this specific task. In this article, an antenna dataset is created to address important antenna interference source detection issues and serves as the basis for subsequent research. We introduce YOLO-Ant, a lightweight CNN and transformer hybrid detector specifically designed for antenna interference source detection. Specifically, we initially formulated a lightweight design for the network depth and width, ensuring that subsequent investigations were conducted within a lightweight framework. Then, we propose a DSLK-Block module based on depthwise separable convolution and large convolution kernels to enhance the network's feature extraction ability, effectively improving small object detection. To address challenges such as complex backgrounds and large interclass differences in antenna detection, we construct DSLKVit-Block, a powerful feature extraction module that combines DSLK-Block and transformer structures. Considering both its lightweight design and accuracy, our method not only achieves optimal performance on the antenna dataset but also yields competitive results on public datasets.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 01:35:23 UTC (14,095 KB)"

"35","A New Radio to Overcome Critical Link Budgets","Ralf R. M√ºller","Information Theory (cs.IT)","We propose Multi-Antenna (MA) Towards Inband Shift Keying (TISK): a new multi-carrier radio concept to cope with critical link budgets. In contrast to common proposals that rely on analog beamforming at both transmitter and receiver, MA-TISK does not require beam alignment. The transmitted signals have all constant envelope in continuous time, which allows for efficient, low-cost power amplification and up-conversion. The concept is compatible with any linear PSK-modulation as well as pulse position modulation. Each sub-carrier is sent over a separate antenna that is equipped with a voltage-controlled oscillator. The phases of these oscillators are controlled by digital baseband. Temporal signal combining makes up for the lack of beamforming gain at the transmitter. A common message may be broadcast to many receivers, simultaneously. Demodulation can be efficiently implemented by means of fast Fourier transform. MA-TISK does not suffer from spectral re-growth issues plaguing other constant envelope modulations like GMSK. Almost rectangular signal spectra similar to those for linear modulation with root-raised-cosine pulse shaping are possible. For the 100 MHz-wide spectral mask of 5G downlink, QPSK-modulation allows for 160 MBit/s with 5.74 MHz subcarrier spacing when using 16 transmit antennas. The wide carrier spacing makes the signals insensitive to Doppler effects. There is no loss in link budget gain compared to spatial beamforming at the transmitter.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 20:16:29 UTC (339 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:31:14 UTC (1 KB) (withdrawn)"

Our study begins by developing a malicious xApp designed to execute adversarial attacks on two types of test data - spectrograms and key performance metrics (KPMs), stored in the RIC database within the near-RT RIC. To mitigate these threats, we utilize a distillation technique that involves training a teacher model at a high softmax temperature and transferring its knowledge to a student model trained at a lower softmax temperature, which is deployed as the robust ML model within xApp. We prototype an over-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed to assess the impact of these attacks and the effectiveness of the distillation defense technique by leveraging an ML-based Interference Classification (InterClass) xApp as an example.

We propose a deterministic combinatorial method for picking the base matrix $H_b$, assuming $n=4t^2$ for some integer $t \geq 2$. We then extend this by obtaining permuted versions of $H_b$ (e.g., via random permutations of its columns) and stacking them on top of each other leading to codes of dimension $k \geq n-2s\sqrt{n}+s$, for some $s \geq 2$, referred to as order-$s$ FDPC codes. We propose methods to explicitly characterize and bound the weight distribution of the new codes and utilize them to derive union-type approximate upper bounds on their error probability under Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding. For the binary erasure channel (BEC), we demonstrate that the approximate ML bound of FDPC codes closely follows the random coding upper bound (RCU) for a wide range of channel parameters. Also, remarkably, FDPC codes, under the low-complexity min-sum decoder, improve upon 5G-LDPC codes for transmission over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (B-AWGN) channel by almost 0.5dB (for $n=1024$, and rate $=0.878$).

However, its reliability as a true representation of reality cannot be taken for granted due to the constant increase in editing software. This makes it easier to alter original content without leaving a noticeable trace in the modification. Therefore, it is essential to introduce forensic analysis mechanisms to guarantee the authenticity or integrity of a certain digital video, particularly if it may be considered as evidence in legal proceedings. This paper explains the branch of multimedia forensic analysis that allows to determine the identification of the source of acquisition of a certain video by exploiting the unique traces left by the camera sensor of the mobile device in visual content. To do this, a technique that performs the identification of the source of acquisition of digital videos from mobile devices is presented.

It serves two essential purposes (a) evaluating the potential for harmful interference to primary users in satellite bands and (b) facilitating the analysis, design, and implementation of diverse regulatory policies on spectrum usage and sharing. Notably, ASCENT implements a closed-loop feedback system that allows dynamic adaptation of policies according to a wide range of contextual factors (e.g., weather, buildings, summer/winter foliage, etc.) and feedback on the impact of these policies through realistic simulation. Specifically, ASCENT comprises the following components (i) interference evaluation tool for evaluating interference at the incumbents in a spectrum-sharing environment while taking the underlying contexts, (ii) dynamic spectrum access (DSA) framework for providing context-aware instructions to adapt networking parameters and control secondary terrestrial network's access to the shared spectrum band according to context aware prioritization, (iii) Context broker to acquire essential and relevant contexts from external context information providers; and (iv) DSA Database to store dynamic and static contexts and the regulator's policy information. The closed-loop feedback system of ASCENT is implemented by integrating these components in a modular software architecture. A case study of sharing the lower 12 GHz Ku band (12.2-12.7 GHz) with the 5G terrestrial cellular network is considered, and the usability of ASCENT is demonstrated by dynamically changing exclusion zone's radius in different weather conditions.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 21:43:17 UTC (9,854 KB)[v2] Wed, 14 Feb 2024 20:56:56 UTC (9,854 KB)[v3] Fri, 16 Feb 2024 02:17:10 UTC (9,854 KB)"

The Spectrum Access System (SAS) ensures that higher priority users are protected from interference from lower priority users. However, the lowest priority GAA users are not given any protection from each other by the SAS and are expected to not cause any harmful interference to Tier 1 and Tier 2 users. As the deployments of GAA devices grow, the potential for secondary interference between GAA users increases, especially since the SAS architecture does not allow dynamic channel switching when faced with interference. In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind extensive measurement campaign of a commercial CBRS network deployed in the city of South Bend, IN, that quantifies both co-channel interference (CCI) and adjacent channel interference (ACI) caused by competing GAA devices and C-band 5G, respectively. We (i) identify a particular CCI scenario and improve performance by changing the frequency allocation based on our study of other allocations in the vicinity and (ii) quantify ACI from 5G in C-band (3.7 GHz) on CBRS throughput. We conclude that (i) CCI and ACI for GAA users is not handled well by the SAS, (ii) proper frequency allocation for GAA requires additional analysis of interference from other GAA users followed by dynamical channel selection, and (iii) utilization of immediate adjacent channels by high power 5G deployments limits the performance of CBRS.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 20:04:54 UTC (3,512 KB)"

TAP is a novel network timing method that aims to achieve sub-microsecond synchronization over air interface. This paper investigates the improvement and end-to-end realization of TAP. This paper first analyzes the effectiveness and deficiencies of TAP by establishing an equivalent clock model which evaluates TAP from timing error composition and allan variance. Second, this paper proposes a detailed base station and terminal design and the corresponding improvement of TAP.

Shah","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","Spectrum sharing between terrestrial 5G and incumbent networks in the satellite bands presents a promising avenue to satisfy the ever-increasing bandwidth demand of the next-generation wireless networks. However, protecting incumbent operations from harmful interference poses a fundamental challenge in accommodating terrestrial broadband cellular networks in the satellite bands. State-of-the-art spectrum-sharing policies usually consider several worst-case assumptions and ignore site-specific contextual factors in making spectrum-sharing decisions, and thus, often results in under-utilization of the shared band for the secondary licensees. To address such limitations, this paper introduces CAT3S (Context-Aware Terrestrial-Satellite Spectrum Sharing) framework that empowers the coexisting terrestrial 5G network to maximize utilization of the shared satellite band without creating harmful interference to the incumbent links by exploiting the contextual factors. CAT3S consists of the following two components: (i) context-acquisition unit to collect and process essential contextual information for spectrum sharing and (ii) context-aware base station (BS) control unit to optimize the set of operational BSs and their operation parameters (i.e., transmit power and active beams per sector). To evaluate the performance of the CAT3S, a realistic spectrum coexistence case study over the 12 GHz band is considered. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CAT3S achieves notably higher spectrum utilization than state-of-the-art spectrum-sharing policies in different weather contexts.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 22:34:57 UTC (932 KB)[v2] Wed, 14 Feb 2024 20:51:16 UTC (932 KB)"

Giridhar","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","The efficiency of the broadcast network is impacted by the different types of services that may be transmitted over it. Global services serve users across the entire network, while local services cater to specific regions, and hyper-local services have even narrower coverage. Multimedia Broadcast over a Single-Frequency Network (MBSFN) is typically used for global service transmission while existing literature extensively discusses schemes for transmitting local or hyper-local services with or without Single Frequency Network (SFN) gain. However, these schemes fall short when network-wide requests for only local and hyper-local services are made, leading operators to scale down to either Single Cell-Point to Multipoint (SCPtM) or Multi-Frequency Network (MFN). SCPtM is highly susceptible to interference, and MFN requires substantial amounts of valuable spectrum. They both employ the Least Channel Gain (LCG) strategy for transmitting hyper-local services without SFN gain. Our proposed Local and Hyper-Local Services (LHS) transmission scheme utilizes the knowledge of user distribution and their corresponding radio link channel quality to schedule single or multi-resolution, local or hyper-local services within a three-cell cluster and aims to enhance spectral efficiency and maximize system throughput. It leverages Scalable Video Coding (SVC) in conjunction with Hierarchical Modulation (HM) for transmitting multi-resolution multimedia content to address the problem of heterogeneity amongst the multicast group users. The proposed scheme also employs macro-diversity combining with optimal HM parameters for each gNB catering to a local service area in order to minimize the service outage. System-level simulation results testify to the better performance achieved by the proposed LHS transmission scheme with respect to SCPtM.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 12:50:39 UTC (4,876 KB)"

Two service types standardized in 5G are eMBB, without stringent delay guarantee, and URLLC, with stringent delay guarantee. We focus on a use case where data timeliness is the relevant quality parameter. We provide an economic rationale for the support of data-based services, that is, from the point of view of the profits attained by the service providers and operators (SP). More specifically, we focus on data-based services the quality of which is related to the Age of Information, and we assess two alternatives for the support of this sort of services by means of a 5G network: one that is based on the eMBB service type, and one that is based on the URLLC service type. These assessment is conducted in a duopoly scenario. We conclude that URLLC support provides a competitive advantage to an SP against a competitor SP that supports its service offering on eMBB. And that there is a slightly better situation for the users when the URLLC QoS constraint is stringent.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 11:44:50 UTC (441 KB)"
"59","A Learning-Based Caching Mechanism for Edge Content Delivery","Hoda Torabi, Hamzeh Khazaei, Marin Litoiu","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","With the advent of 5G networks and the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are increasingly extending into the network edge. This shift introduces unique challenges, particularly due to the limited cache storage and the diverse request patterns at the edge. These edge environments can host traffic classes characterized by varied object-size distributions and object-access patterns. Such complexity makes it difficult for traditional caching strategies, which often rely on metrics like request frequency or time intervals, to be effective. Despite these complexities, the optimization of edge caching is crucial. Improved byte hit rates at the edge not only alleviate the load on the network backbone but also minimize operational costs and expedite content delivery to end-users. In this paper, we introduce HR-Cache, a comprehensive learning-based caching framework grounded in the principles of Hazard Rate (HR) ordering, a rule originally formulated to compute an upper bound on cache performance. HR-Cache leverages this rule to guide future object eviction decisions. It employs a lightweight machine learning model to learn from caching decisions made based on HR ordering, subsequently predicting the ""cache-friendliness"" of incoming requests. Objects deemed ""cache-averse"" are placed into cache as priority candidates for eviction. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HR-Cache not only consistently enhances byte hit rates compared to existing state-of-the-art methods but also achieves this with minimal prediction overhead. Our experimental results, using three real-world traces and one synthetic trace, indicate that HR-Cache consistently achieves 2.2-14.6% greater WAN traffic savings than LRU. It outperforms not only heuristic caching strategies but also the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithm.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 08:06:03 UTC (186 KB)"

Previously, the presence of the orbital collapse was established for the $4f$ and $5f$ elements of the periodic table. Because of the large centrifugal term for the $f$ and $g$ electrons, the effective radial potential has two wells, one narrow and deep and the other wide but shallow. Depending on the external parameters, the electron can be either localized in the outer well with low binding energy and large average radius or in the inner one with higher energy and smaller radius. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of the orbital collapse for the $5g$ electrons when changing the total angular momentum $J$ of the atom. We also found that for some SHE elements, two different solutions of the same Dirac-Fock equations may coexist, with the $5g$ electron localized either in the inner or outer well. In both cases, the radial wave functions are nodeless. The problem of the dual-state coexistence is studied by the configuration-interaction method in the Dirac-Fock-Sturm orbital basis as well.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 20:53:45 UTC (167 KB)"

However, acquiring the spatial correlation matrix to enable efficient channel estimation is a complex task due to the vast number of antenna dimensions. Recently, a new estimation method called the ""reduced-subspace least squares (RS-LS) estimator"" has been proposed for densely packed arrays. This method relies solely on the geometry of the array to limit the estimation resources. In this paper, we address a gap in the existing literature by deriving the average spectral efficiency for a certain distribution of user equipments (UEs) and a lower bound on it when using the RS-LS estimator. This bound is determined by the channel gain and the statistics of the normalized spatial correlation matrices of potential UEs but, importantly, does not require knowledge of a specific UE's spatial correlation matrix. We establish that there exists a pilot length that maximizes this expression. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for the optimal pilot length under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Simulation results validate the tightness of the derived lower bound and the effectiveness of using the optimized pilot length.","Fri, 2 Feb 2024 14:14:15 UTC (141 KB)"

Finally, we provide an approximation of the bit error probability (BEP) using the well-known BEP expressions for Gray-coded QAM constellations over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, and show numerical results that confirm that the proposed BEP expression approximates accurately the bit error ratio (BER) of the OFDM system for standardized channel models. The proposed closed-form analytical expressions for the capacity and the BEP do not only allow for discarding the need of computationally-costly Monte-Carlo system simulations, but also provide a theoretical framework to optimize the system parameters directly impacting on the achievable performance.","Sat, 27 Jan 2024 10:44:47 UTC (922 KB)"

Rost","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","Due to an ever-increasing number of participants and new areas of application, the demands on mobile communications systems are continually increasing. In order to deliver higher data rates, enable mobility and guarantee QoS requirements of subscribers, these systems and the protocols used are becoming more complex. By using higher frequency spectrums, cells become smaller and more base stations have to be deployed. This leads to an increased number of handovers of user equipments between base stations in order to enable mobility, resulting in potentially more frequent radio link failures and rate reduction. The persistent switching between the same base stations, commonly referred to as ""ping-pong"", leads to a consistent reduction of data rates. In this work, we propose a method for handover optimization by using proximal policy optimization in mobile communications to learn an adaptive handover protocol. The resulting agent is highly flexible regarding different travelling speeds of user equipments, while outperforming the standard 5G NR handover protocol by 3GPP in terms of average data rate and number of radio link failures. Furthermore, the design of the proposed environment demonstrates remarkable accuracy, ensuring a fair comparison with the standard 3GPP protocol.","Fri, 26 Jan 2024 12:51:26 UTC (334 KB)"

Moreover, in multi-band networks, non-uniform traffic distribution among different operational bands can lead to congestion, which can adversely impact the user's quality of experience. Load balancing is a critical aspect of network optimization, where it ensures that the traffic is evenly distributed among different bands, avoiding congestion and ensuring better user experience. Traditional load balancing approaches rely only on the band channel quality as a load indicator and to move UEs between bands, which disregards the UE's demands and the band resource, and hence, leading to a suboptimal balancing and utilization of resources. To address this challenge, we propose an event-based algorithm, in which we model the load balancing problem as a multi-objective stochastic optimization, and assign UEs to bands in a probabilistic manner. The goal is to evenly distribute traffic across available bands according to their resources, while maintaining minimal number of inter-frequency handovers to avoid the signaling overhead and the interruption time. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enhances the network's performance and outperforms traditional load balancing approaches in terms of throughput and interruption time.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 20:21:56 UTC (2,157 KB)"

The UE identifies itself by embedding a Preamble Index (RAPID) in the phase rotation of a known base sequence, which it transmits on the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). The signal on the PRACH also enables the estimation of propagation delay, often known as Timing Advance (TA), which is induced by virtue of the UE's position. Traditional receivers estimate the RAPID and TA using correlation-based techniques.

However, the energy consumption (EC) characteristic of sensor nodes is a key factor that affects the operational performance (e.g., lifetime of sensors) and the total cost of ownership of WSNs. In this paper, to find the modulation techniques suitable for WSNs, we investigate the EC characteristic of continuous phase modulation (CPM), which is an attractive modulation scheme candidate for WSNs because of its constant envelope property. We first develop an EC model for the sensor nodes of WSNs by considering the circuits and a typical communication protocol that relies on automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based retransmissions to ensure successful data delivery. Then, we use this model to analyze the EC characteristic of CPM under various configurations of modulation parameters. Furthermore, we compare the EC characteristic of CPM with that of other representative modulation schemes, such as offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which are commonly used in communication protocols of WSNs. Our analysis and simulation results provide insights into the EC characteristics of multiple modulation schemes in the context of WSNs; thus, they are beneficial for designing energy-efficient SG-IoT in the beyond-5G (B5G) and the 6G era.","Sun, 21 Jan 2024 09:59:48 UTC (1,273 KB)"

Although the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) can accomplish this requirement in trusted environments, it becomes unreliable in the presence of specific cyber attacks. Mainly, time delay attacks pose the highest threat to the protocol, enabling attackers to diverge targeted clocks undetected. With the increasing danger of cyber attacks, especially against critical infrastructure, there is a great demand for effective countermeasures to secure both time synchronization and the applications that depend on it. However, current solutions are not sufficiently capable of mitigating sophisticated delay attacks. For example, they lack proper integration into the PTP protocol, scalability, or sound evaluation with the required microsecond-level accuracy. This work proposes an approach to detect and counteract delay attacks against PTP based on cyclic path asymmetry measurements over redundant paths. For that, we provide a method to find redundant paths in arbitrary networks and show how this redundancy can be exploited to reveal and mitigate undesirable asymmetries on the synchronization path that cause the malicious clock divergence. Furthermore, we propose PTPsec, a secure PTP protocol and its implementation based on the latest IEEE 1588-2019 standard. With PTPsec, we advance the conventional PTP to support reliable delay attack detection and mitigation. We validate our approach on a hardware testbed, which includes an attacker capable of performing static and incremental delay attacks at a microsecond precision. Our experimental results show that all attack scenarios can be reliably detected and mitigated with minimal detection time.","Fri, 19 Jan 2024 12:35:00 UTC (904 KB)[v2] Wed, 7 Feb 2024 09:40:34 UTC (904 KB)"

The 5G-MEC has gained significant recognition in task offloading as an essential tool for applications that require low delay. Nevertheless, few studies consider the dropped task ratio metric.

Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged. Alternative solutions have been surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks.

In this paper, we propose a cooperative tri-point (CoTP) model-based method that utilizes cooperative beams to enhance the G2A coverage extension. To utilize existing TBSs for establishing effective cooperation, we prove that the cooperation among three TBSs can ensure G2A coverage with a minimum coverage overlap, and design the CoTP model to analyze the G2A coverage extension. Using the model, a cooperative coverage structure based on Delaunay triangulation is designed to divide triangular prism-shaped subspaces and corresponding TBS cooperation sets. To enable TBSs in the cooperation set to cover different height subspaces while maintaining ground coverage, we design a cooperative beam generation algorithm to maximize the coverage in the triangular prism-shaped airspace.

In this paper, we study the joint optimization of beam direction and the allocation of spectrum, time, and power resource in a dynamic multi-beam LEO satellite network. The objective is to improve long-term user sum data rate while taking user fairness into account. Since the concerned resource management problem is mixed-integer non-convex programming, the problem is decomposed into three subproblems, namely beam direction control and time slot allocation, user subchannel assignment, and beam power allocation.

However, with the evolving cyber threat landscape, IoT devices have become more vulnerable to the broader risk surface (e.g., risks associated with generative AI, 5G-IoT, etc.), which, if exploited, may lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of command and control and potential harm. This paper reviews the fundamentals of healthcare IoT, its privacy, and data security challenges associated with machine learning and H-IoT devices. The paper further emphasizes the importance of monitoring healthcare IoT layers such as perception, network, cloud, and application. Detecting and responding to anomalies involves various cyber-attacks and protocols such as Wi-Fi 6, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, and 5G New Radio (5G NR). A robust authentication mechanism based on machine learning and deep learning techniques is required to protect and mitigate H-IoT devices from increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Hence, in this review paper, security and privacy challenges and risk mitigation strategies for building resilience in H-IoT are explored and reported.","Wed, 17 Jan 2024 10:55:26 UTC (6,122 KB)"

Up to the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks, these four theories have been developing relatively independently. However, in sixth generation (6G) space-air-ground-sea wireless communication networks, seamless coverage is expected in the three-dimensional (3D) space, potentially necessitating the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) and channel capacity calculation at anywhere and any time. Additionally, the key 6G technologies such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and holographic MIMO achieves intricate interaction of the antennas and wireless propagation environments, which necessitates the joint modeling of antennas and wireless propagation channels. To address the challenges in 6G, the integration of the above four theories becomes inevitable, leading to the concept of the so-called electromagnetic information theory (EIT). In this article, a suite of 6G key technologies is highlighted. Then, the concepts and relationships of the four theories are unveiled.

Fettweis, Wolfgang Kellerer","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","The hand blockage effect of the human hand around the user equipment (UE) is too considerable to be ignored in frequency range 2 (FR2). This adds another layer of complexity to the link budget design in FR2 for 5G networks, which already suffer from high path and diffraction loss. More recently, multipanel UEs (MPUEs) have been proposed as a way to address this problem, whereby multiple distinct antenna panels are integrated into the UE body as a way to leverage gains from antenna directivity. MPUEs also enhance the Rx-beamforming gain because it is now subject to each individual antenna panel. In this paper, the mobility performance of hand blockage induced by three practical hand grips is analyzed in a system-level simulation, where in each grip both the UE orientation and the hand positioning around the UE is different. It is seen that each hand grip has a significant impact on mobility performance of the network, where in the worst case mobility failures increase by 43% compared to the non-hand blockage case. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the tradeoff between the mobility key performance indicators and the panel and Rx beam switching frequency is also studied. Results have shown that both the panel and Rx beam switches can be reduced considerably without compromising on the mobility performance. This is beneficial because it helps in reducing UE power consumption.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 16:17:13 UTC (2,239 KB)"

However, efficient management method of the large-scale antenna arrays deployed by those radio technologies is crucial. Traditional management methods are mainly reactive, usually based on feedback from users to adapt to the dynamic wireless channel. However, a more promising approach lies in the prediction of spatial channel state information (spatial-CSI), which is an all-inclusive channel characterization and consists of all the feasible line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), with the three-dimension (3D) trajectory, attenuation, phase shift, delay, and polarization of each path. Advances in hardware and neural networks make it possible to predict such spatial-CSI using precise environmental information, and further look into the possibility of holographic communication, which implies complete control over every aspect of the radio waves emitted. Based on the integration of holographic communication and digital twin, we proposed a new framework, digital radio twin, which takes advantages from both the digital world and deterministic control over radio waves, supporting a wide range of high-level applications.

Since the impact of positive feedback (i.e., ACK) error is smaller than that of negative feedback (i.e., NACK) error, an asymmetric feedback detection scheme is proposed to protect NACK and further reduce the outage probability. We formulate the HARQ process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to adapt to the transmission rate of each transmission attempt without enriched feedback and additional feedback cost. We aim to optimize the performance of HARQ process under certain outage probability requirements by finding optimal asymmetric detection thresholds.

Extreme value theory (EVT) has been previously adopted in channel modeling to characterize the lower tail of received powers in URC systems. In this paper, we propose a multivariate EVT (MEVT)-based channel modeling methodology for tail of the joint distribution of multi-channel by characterizing the multivariate extremes of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The proposed approach derives lower tail statistics of received power of each channel by using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Then, tail of the joint distribution is modeled as a function of estimated GPD parameters based on two approaches: logistic distribution, which utilizes logistic distribution to determine dependency factors among the Frechet transformed tail sequence and obtain a bi-variate extreme value model, and Poisson point process, which estimates probability measure function of the Pickands angular component to model bi-variate extreme values. Finally, validity of the proposed models is assessed by incorporating the mean constraint on probability measure function of Pichanks coordinates. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the superiority of proposed methodology compared to the conventional extrapolation-based methods in providing the best fit to the multivariate extremes.","Thu, 11 Jan 2024 11:04:35 UTC (1,177 KB)"

The use of mmWave for various applications including vehicular communications has been extensively discussed. However, applying mmWave to vehicular communications faces challenges of high mobility nodes and narrow coverage along the mmWave beams. Due to high mobility in dense networks, overlapping beams can cause strong interference which leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, beam switching capability in mmWave can be utilized. Then, frequent beam switching and cell change become inevitable to manage interference, which increase computational and signalling complexity. In order to deal with the complexity in interference control, we develop a new strategy called Multi-Agent Context Learning (MACOL), which utilizes Contextual Bandit to manage interference while allocating mmWave beams to serve vehicles in the network. Our approach demonstrates that by leveraging knowledge of neighbouring beam status, the machine learning agent can identify and avoid potential interfering transmissions to other ongoing transmissions. Furthermore, we show that even under heavy traffic loads, our proposed MACOL strategy is able to maintain low interference levels at around 10%.","Thu, 4 Jan 2024 15:43:55 UTC (4,031 KB)"

We develop an xApp for the near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) that embeds a heuristic algorithm for latency control, aiming to: (1) maintain latency of a VR stream around a requested value; and (2) improve the available RAN allocation to offer higher bit rate to another user. We have experimentally demonstrated the proposed approach in an ORAN testbed.

The number of mobile devices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every year. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the explosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of growth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining various improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new technologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network densification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new waveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates significant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is essential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate severe and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks.

This paper will discuss the possible evolution of these two types of connectivity within the umbrella of 6G wireless systems. The paper consists of three parts. The first part deals with the connectivity for a massive number of devices. While mMTC research in 5G was predominantly focused on the problem of uncoordinated access in the uplink for a large number of devices, the traffic patterns in 6G may become more symmetric, leading to closed-loop massive connectivity. One of the drivers for this is distributed learning/inference. The second part of the paper will discuss the evolution of wireless connectivity for critical services. While latency and reliability are tightly coupled in 5G, 6G will support a variety of safety critical control applications with different types of timing requirements, as evidenced by the emergence of metrics related to information freshness and information value. Additionally, ensuring ultra-high reliability for safety critical control applications requires modeling and estimation of the tail statistics of the wireless channel, queue length, and delay. The fulfillment of these stringent requirements calls for the development of novel AI-based techniques, incorporating optimization theory, explainable AI, generative AI and digital twins. The third part will analyze the coexistence of massive connectivity and critical services.

"147","Coordinated Navigation Control of Cross-Domain Unmanned Systems via Guiding Vector Fields","Bin-Bin Hu, Hai-Tao Zhang, Bin Liu, Jianing Ding, Yifan Xu, Chuanshang Luo, Haosen Cao","Robotics (cs.RO)","This paper proposes a distributed guiding-vector-field (DGVF) controller for cross-domain unmanned systems (CDUSs) consisting of heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), to achieve coordinated navigation whereas maneuvering along their prescribed paths. In particular, the DGVF controller provides a hierarchical architecture of an upper-level heterogeneous guidance velocity controller and a lower-level signal tracking regulator. Therein, the upper-level controller is to govern multiple heterogeneous USVs and UAVs to approach and maneuver along the prescribed paths and coordinate the formation simultaneously, whereas the low-level regulator is to track the corresponding desired guidance signals provided by the upper-level module. Significantly, the heterogeneous coordination among neighboring UAVs and USVs is achieved merely by the lightweight communication of a scalar (i.e., the additional virtual coordinate), which substantially decreases the communication and computational costs. Sufficient conditions assuring asymptotical convergence of the closed-loop system are derived in presence of the exponentially vanishing tracking errors. Finally, real-lake experiments are conducted on a self-established cross-domain heterogeneous platform consisting of three M-100 UAVs, two HUSTER-16 USVs, a HUSTER-12C USV, and a WiFi 5G wireless communication station to verify the effectiveness of the present DGVF controller.","Mon, 18 Dec 2023 05:50:18 UTC (9,711 KB)"

However, current DTNs networking frameworks pose a number of challenges especially when applied in scenarios that require high communication efficiency and multimodal data processing. First, current DTNs frameworks are unavoidable regarding high resource consumption and communication congestion because of original bit-level communication and high-frequency computation, especially distributed learning-based DTNs. Second, current machine learning models for DTNs are domain-specific (e.g. E-health), making it difficult to handle DT scenarios with multimodal data processing requirements. Last but not least, current security schemes for DTNs, such as blockchain, introduce additional overheads that impair the efficiency of DTNs. To address the above challenges, we propose a large language model (LLM) empowered DTNs networking framework, LLM-Twin. First, we design the mini-giant model collaboration scheme to achieve efficient deployment of LLM in DTNs, since LLM are naturally conducive to processing multimodal data. Then, we design a semantic-level high-efficiency, and secure communication model for DTNs. The feasibility of LLM-Twin is demonstrated by numerical experiments and case studies. To our knowledge, this is the first to propose LLM-based semantic-level digital twin networking framework.","Sun, 17 Dec 2023 07:13:59 UTC (5,760 KB)"
"149","Resource Allocation for Secure Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency-Communication in IoT Applications","Solmaz Sorkhi Asbaghi, Mahmood Mohassel Feghhi, Javad Musevi niya","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","The Internet of Things (IoT) has a significant demand in society due to its features, and it is constantly improving. In the context of wireless technology, Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is one of the essential and challenging services in fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond. The research on URLLC is still in its early stages due to its conflicting requirements, regarding high reliability and low latency. In this paper, we study the performance of secure short-packet communications and resource allocation in IoT systems. To this end, we investigate a health center automation, where the goal of the access point is to send critical messages to devices without eavesdropping. In this context, our goal is to maximize the weighted sum throughput and minimize the total transmit power, respectively. The problems of maximizing the weighted sum throughput, and minimizing the total transmit power are non-convex and hard to solve. To overcome this challenge, we use efficient mathematical techniques, such as the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and gradient ascent algorithm; we also use estimation methods such as Ralston, Heun, and forward-backward, in the derivative part of the gradient ascent algorithm. The simulation results show the performance advantages of the BCD algorithm and the gradient ascent in the short packet transmission scheme, also the simulation results show the superiority of the proposed methods in most cases.","Sat, 16 Dec 2023 23:02:34 UTC (1,184 KB)"

Shin, Bo Ai","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","As required by Industry 4.0, companies will move towards flexible and individual manufacturing. To succeed in this transition, convergence of 5G and time-sensitive networks (TSN) is the most promising technology and has thus attracted considerable interest from industry and standardization groups. However, the delay and jitter of end-to-end (e2e) transmission will get exacerbated if the transmission opportunities are missed in TSN due to the 5G transmission jitter and the clock skew between the two network systems. To mitigate this phenomenon, we propose a novel asynchronous access mechanism (AAM) that isolates the jitter only in the 5G system and ensures zero transmission jitter in TSN. We then exploit AAM to develop an e2e asynchronous traffic scheduling model for coordinated allocation of resources for 5G and TSN to provide e2e transmission delay guarantees for time-critical flows. The results of our extensive simulation of AAM on OMNET++ corroborate the superior performance of AAM and the scheduling model.","Sat, 16 Dec 2023 06:58:56 UTC (6,742 KB)"
